Slide 21:
Codes are for ball sprite, not goalkeeper

Slide 30 & 31 / Step 25 & 26:

Unnecessary steps as there are no "When I receive 'Win'/ 'Lose'" blocks corresponding to these broadcast messages and there are already blocks in the Text sprite template that demonstrate all the winning and losing conditions.

Additional touch to Text sprite template:
When I receive Goal:
	if Ball = 0 and not Score = 5
	switch costume to Goal (NOT Miss)

When I receive Miss:
	if Score = 0
	switch costume to Miss
	wait 1 sec
	switch costume to 0
