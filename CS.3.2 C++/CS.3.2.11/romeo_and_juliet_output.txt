43 THE PROLOGUE
44 ============
45 [Enter Chorus.]
46 
47 
48 Two households, both alike in dignity
49 (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
50 From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
51 Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
52 From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
53 A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
54 Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
55 Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
56 The fearful passage of their death-marked love
57 And the continuance of their parents' rage,
58 Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
59 Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
60 The which, if you with patient ears attend,
61 What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

68 Scene 1
69 =======
70 [Enter Sampson and Gregory, with swords and bucklers,
71 of the house of Capulet.]
72 
73 
74 SAMPSON  Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals.
75 
76 GREGORY  No, for then we should be colliers.
77 
78 SAMPSON  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
79 
80 GREGORY  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of
81 collar.
82 
83 SAMPSON  I strike quickly, being moved.
84 
85 GREGORY  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
86 
87 SAMPSON  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
88 
89 GREGORY  To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to
90 stand. Therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st
91 away.
92 
93 SAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I
94 will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
95 
96 GREGORY  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest
97 goes to the wall.
98 
99 SAMPSON  'Tis true, and therefore women, being the
100 weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore
101 I will push Montague's men from the wall and
102 thrust his maids to the wall.
103 
104 GREGORY  The quarrel is between our masters and us
105 their men.
106 
107 SAMPSON  'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.
108 When I have fought with the men, I will be civil
109 with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
110 
111 GREGORY  The heads of the maids?
112 
113 SAMPSON  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
114 Take it in what sense thou wilt.
115 
116 GREGORY  They must take it in sense that feel it.
117 
118 SAMPSON  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,
119 and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
120 
121 GREGORY  'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
122 hadst been poor-john. Draw thy tool. Here comes
123 of the house of Montagues.
124 
125 [Enter Abram with another Servingman.]
126 
127 
128 SAMPSON  My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back
129 thee.
130 
131 GREGORY  How? Turn thy back and run?
132 
133 SAMPSON  Fear me not.
134 
135 GREGORY  No, marry. I fear thee!
136 
137 SAMPSON  Let us take the law of our sides; let them
138 begin.
139 
140 GREGORY  I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it
141 as they list.
142 
143 SAMPSON  Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at
144 them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.
145 [He bites his thumb.]
146 
147 ABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
148 
149 SAMPSON  I do bite my thumb, sir.
150 
151 ABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
152 
153 SAMPSON, [aside to Gregory]  Is the law of our side if I
154 say "Ay"?
155 
156 GREGORY, [aside to Sampson]  No.
157 
158 SAMPSON  No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
159 but I bite my thumb, sir.
160 
161 GREGORY  Do you quarrel, sir?
162 
163 ABRAM  Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
164 
165 SAMPSON  But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as
166 good a man as you.
167 
168 ABRAM  No better.
169 
170 SAMPSON  Well, sir.
171 
172 [Enter Benvolio.]
173 
174 
175 GREGORY, [aside to Sampson]  Say "better"; here comes
176 one of my master's kinsmen.
177 
178 SAMPSON  Yes, better, sir.
179 
180 ABRAM  You lie.
181 
182 SAMPSON  Draw if you be men.--Gregory, remember
183 thy washing blow.	[They fight.]
184 
185 BENVOLIO  Part, fools!	[Drawing his sword.]
186 Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
187 
188 [Enter Tybalt, drawing his sword.]
189 
190 
191 TYBALT
192 What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
193 Turn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.
194 
195 BENVOLIO
196 I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
197 Or manage it to part these men with me.
198 
199 TYBALT
200 What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word
201 As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
202 Have at thee, coward!	[They fight.]
203 
204 [Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.]
205 
206 
207 CITIZENS
208 Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
209 Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
210 
211 [Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.]
212 
213 
214 CAPULET
215 What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
216 
217 LADY CAPULET
218 A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a
219 sword?
220 
221 [Enter old Montague and his Wife.]
222 
223 CAPULET
224 My sword, I say. Old Montague is come
225 And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
226 
227 MONTAGUE
228 Thou villain Capulet!--Hold me not; let me go.
229 
230 LADY MONTAGUE
231 Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
232 
233 [Enter Prince Escalus with his train.]
234 
235 
236 PRINCE
237 Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
238 Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel--
239 Will they not hear?--What ho! You men, you beasts,
240 That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
241 With purple fountains issuing from your veins:
242 On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
243 Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,
244 And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
245 Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
246 By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
247 Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets
248 And made Verona's ancient citizens
249 Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments
250 To wield old partisans in hands as old,
251 Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.
252 If ever you disturb our streets again,
253 Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
254 For this time all the rest depart away.
255 You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
256 And, Montague, come you this afternoon
257 To know our farther pleasure in this case,
258 To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
259 Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
260 [All but Montague, Lady Montague,
261 and Benvolio exit.]
262 
263 MONTAGUE, [to Benvolio]
264 Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
265 Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
266 
267 BENVOLIO
268 Here were the servants of your adversary,
269 And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
270 I drew to part them. In the instant came
271 The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,
272 Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
273 He swung about his head and cut the winds,
274 Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
275 While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
276 Came more and more and fought on part and part,
277 Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
278 
279 LADY MONTAGUE
280 O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
281 Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
282 
283 BENVOLIO
284 Madam, an hour before the worshiped sun
285 Peered forth the golden window of the east,
286 A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,
287 Where underneath the grove of sycamore
288 That westward rooteth from this city side,
289 So early walking did I see your son.
290 Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me
291 And stole into the covert of the wood.
292 I, measuring his affections by my own
293 (Which then most sought where most might not be
294 found,
295 Being one too many by my weary self),
296 Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,
297 And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
298 
299 MONTAGUE
300 Many a morning hath he there been seen,
301 With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
302 Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
303 But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
304 Should in the farthest east begin to draw
305 The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
306 Away from light steals home my heavy son
307 And private in his chamber pens himself,
308 Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
309 And makes himself an artificial night.
310 Black and portentous must this humor prove,
311 Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
312 
313 BENVOLIO
314 My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
315 
316 MONTAGUE
317 I neither know it nor can learn of him.
318 
319 BENVOLIO
320 Have you importuned him by any means?
321 
322 MONTAGUE
323 Both by myself and many other friends.
324 But he, his own affections' counselor,
325 Is to himself--I will not say how true,
326 But to himself so secret and so close,
327 So far from sounding and discovery,
328 As is the bud bit with an envious worm
329 Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
330 Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
331 Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
332 We would as willingly give cure as know.
333 
334 [Enter Romeo.]
335 
336 
337 BENVOLIO
338 See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
339 I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
340 
341 MONTAGUE
342 I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
343 To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away.
344 [Montague and Lady Montague exit.]
345 
346 BENVOLIO
347 Good morrow, cousin.
348 
349 ROMEO  Is the day so young?
350 
351 BENVOLIO
352 But new struck nine.
353 
354 ROMEO  Ay me, sad hours seem long.
355 Was that my father that went hence so fast?
356 
357 BENVOLIO
358 It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
359 
360 ROMEO
361 Not having that which, having, makes them short.
362 
363 BENVOLIO  In love?
364 
365 ROMEO  Out--
366 
367 BENVOLIO  Of love?
368 
369 ROMEO
370 Out of her favor where I am in love.
371 
372 BENVOLIO
373 Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
374 Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
375 
376 ROMEO
377 Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
378 Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
379 Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?
380 Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
381 Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
382 Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
383 O anything of nothing first create!
384 O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
385 Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,
386 Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
387 Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!
388 This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
389 Dost thou not laugh?
390 
391 BENVOLIO  No, coz, I rather weep.
392 
393 ROMEO
394 Good heart, at what?
395 
396 BENVOLIO  At thy good heart's oppression.
397 
398 ROMEO  Why, such is love's transgression.
399 Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
400 Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
401 With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
402 Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
403 Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
404 Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
405 Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
406 What is it else? A madness most discreet,
407 A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
408 Farewell, my coz.
409 
410 BENVOLIO  Soft, I will go along.
411 An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
412 
413 ROMEO
414 Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
415 This is not Romeo. He's some other where.
416 
417 BENVOLIO
418 Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
419 
420 ROMEO  What, shall I groan and tell thee?
421 
422 BENVOLIO
423 Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.
424 
425 ROMEO
426 A sick man in sadness makes his will--
427 A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
428 In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
429 
430 BENVOLIO
431 I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
432 
433 ROMEO
434 A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
435 
436 BENVOLIO
437 A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
438 
439 ROMEO
440 Well in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
441 With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
442 And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,
443 From love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
444 She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
445 Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
446 Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
447 O, she is rich in beauty, only poor
448 That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
449 
450 BENVOLIO
451 Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
452 
453 ROMEO
454 She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
455 For beauty, starved with her severity,
456 Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
457 She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
458 To merit bliss by making me despair.
459 She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
460 Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
461 
462 BENVOLIO
463 Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
464 
465 ROMEO
466 O, teach me how I should forget to think!
467 
468 BENVOLIO
469 By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
470 Examine other beauties.
471 
472 ROMEO  'Tis the way
473 To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
474 These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
475 Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
476 He that is strucken blind cannot forget
477 The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
478 Show me a mistress that is passing fair;
479 What doth her beauty serve but as a note
480 Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
481 Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
482 
483 BENVOLIO
484 I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.
485 [They exit.]
486 
487 Scene 2
488 =======
489 [Enter Capulet, County Paris, and a Servingman.]
490 
491 
492 CAPULET
493 But Montague is bound as well as I,
494 In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard, I think,
495 For men so old as we to keep the peace.
496 
497 PARIS
498 Of honorable reckoning are you both,
499 And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
500 But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
501 
502 CAPULET
503 But saying o'er what I have said before.
504 My child is yet a stranger in the world.
505 She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
506 Let two more summers wither in their pride
507 Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
508 
509 PARIS
510 Younger than she are happy mothers made.
511 
512 CAPULET
513 And too soon marred are those so early made.
514 Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
515 She's the hopeful lady of my earth.
516 But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
517 My will to her consent is but a part.
518 And, she agreed, within her scope of choice
519 Lies my consent and fair according voice.
520 This night I hold an old accustomed feast,
521 Whereto I have invited many a guest
522 Such as I love; and you among the store,
523 One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
524 At my poor house look to behold this night
525 Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
526 Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
527 When well-appareled April on the heel
528 Of limping winter treads, even such delight
529 Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night
530 Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
531 And like her most whose merit most shall be;
532 Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
533 May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
534 Come go with me.	[To Servingman, giving him a list.]
535 Go, sirrah, trudge about
536 Through fair Verona, find those persons out
537 Whose names are written there, and to them say
538 My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
539 [Capulet and Paris exit.]
540 
541 SERVINGMAN  Find them out whose names are written
542 here! It is written that the shoemaker should
543 meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
544 fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.
545 But I am sent to find those persons whose names
546 are here writ, and can never find what names the
547 writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned.
548 In good time!
549 
550 [Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]
551 
552 
553 BENVOLIO, [to Romeo]
554 Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
555 One pain is lessened by another's anguish.
556 Turn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.
557 One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
558 Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
559 And the rank poison of the old will die.
560 
561 ROMEO
562 Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
563 
564 BENVOLIO
565 For what, I pray thee?
566 
567 ROMEO  For your broken shin.
568 
569 BENVOLIO  Why Romeo, art thou mad?
570 
571 ROMEO
572 Not mad, but bound more than a madman is,
573 Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
574 Whipped and tormented, and--good e'en, good
575 fellow.
576 
577 SERVINGMAN  God gi' good e'en. I pray, sir, can you
578 read?
579 
580 ROMEO
581 Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
582 
583 SERVINGMAN  Perhaps you have learned it without
584 book. But I pray, can you read anything you see?
585 
586 ROMEO
587 Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
588 
589 SERVINGMAN  You say honestly. Rest you merry.
590 
591 ROMEO  Stay, fellow. I can read.	[(He reads the letter.)]
592 Signior Martino and his wife and daughters,
593 County Anselme and his beauteous sisters,
594 The lady widow of Vitruvio,
595 Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces,
596 Mercutio and his brother Valentine,
597 Mine Uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters,
598 My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
599 Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,
600 Lucio and the lively Helena.
601 A fair assembly. Whither should they come?
602 
603 SERVINGMAN  Up.
604 
605 ROMEO  Whither? To supper?
606 
607 SERVINGMAN  To our house.
608 
609 ROMEO  Whose house?
610 
611 SERVINGMAN  My master's.
612 
613 ROMEO
614 Indeed I should have asked thee that before.
615 
616 SERVINGMAN  Now I'll tell you without asking. My
617 master is the great rich Capulet, and, if you be not
618 of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a
619 cup of wine. Rest you merry.	[He exits.]
620 
621 BENVOLIO
622 At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
623 Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves,
624 With all the admired beauties of Verona.
625 Go thither, and with unattainted eye
626 Compare her face with some that I shall show,
627 And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
628 
629 ROMEO
630 When the devout religion of mine eye
631 Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
632 And these who, often drowned, could never die,
633 Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
634 One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
635 Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
636 
637 BENVOLIO
638 Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
639 Herself poised with herself in either eye;
640 But in that crystal scales let there be weighed
641 Your lady's love against some other maid
642 That I will show you shining at this feast,
643 And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
644 
645 ROMEO
646 I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
647 But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

650 Scene 3
651 =======
652 [Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]
653 
654 
655 LADY CAPULET
656 Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
657 
658 NURSE
659 Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
660 I bade her come.--What, lamb! What, ladybird!
661 God forbid. Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
662 
663 [Enter Juliet.]
664 
665 
666 JULIET  How now, who calls?
667 
668 NURSE  Your mother.
669 
670 JULIET
671 Madam, I am here. What is your will?
672 
673 LADY CAPULET
674 This is the matter.--Nurse, give leave awhile.
675 We must talk in secret.--Nurse, come back again.
676 I have remembered me, thou 's hear our counsel.
677 Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
678 
679 NURSE
680 Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
681 
682 LADY CAPULET  She's not fourteen.
683 
684 NURSE  I'll lay fourteen of my teeth (and yet, to my teen
685 be it spoken, I have but four) she's not fourteen.
686 How long is it now to Lammastide?
687 
688 LADY CAPULET  A fortnight and odd days.
689 
690 NURSE
691 Even or odd, of all days in the year,
692 Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
693 Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
694 Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
695 She was too good for me. But, as I said,
696 On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
697 That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.
698 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,
699 And she was weaned (I never shall forget it)
700 Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
701 For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
702 Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
703 My lord and you were then at Mantua.
704 Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
705 When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
706 Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
707 To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.
708 "Shake," quoth the dovehouse. 'Twas no need, I
709 trow,
710 To bid me trudge.
711 And since that time it is eleven years.
712 For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th'
713 rood,
714 She could have run and waddled all about,
715 For even the day before, she broke her brow,
716 And then my husband (God be with his soul,
717 He was a merry man) took up the child.
718 "Yea," quoth he, "Dost thou fall upon thy face?
719 Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,
720 Wilt thou not, Jule?" And, by my holidam,
721 The pretty wretch left crying and said "Ay."
722 To see now how a jest shall come about!
723 I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
724 I never should forget it. "Wilt thou not, Jule?"
725 quoth he.
726 And, pretty fool, it stinted and said "Ay."
727 
728 LADY CAPULET
729 Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.
730 
731 NURSE
732 Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh
733 To think it should leave crying and say "Ay."
734 And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
735 A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone,
736 A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
737 "Yea," quoth my husband. "Fall'st upon thy face?
738 Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,
739 Wilt thou not, Jule?" It stinted and said "Ay."
740 
741 JULIET
742 And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
743 
744 NURSE
745 Peace. I have done. God mark thee to his grace,
746 Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
747 An I might live to see thee married once,
748 I have my wish.
749 
750 LADY CAPULET
751 Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
752 I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,
753 How stands your disposition to be married?
754 
755 JULIET
756 It is an honor that I dream not of.
757 
758 NURSE
759 An honor? Were not I thine only nurse,
760 I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy
761 teat.
762 
763 LADY CAPULET
764 Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you
765 Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
766 Are made already mothers. By my count
767 I was your mother much upon these years
768 That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:
769 The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
770 
771 NURSE
772 A man, young lady--lady, such a man
773 As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
774 
775 LADY CAPULET
776 Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
777 
778 NURSE
779 Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.
780 
781 LADY CAPULET
782 What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
783 This night you shall behold him at our feast.
784 Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
785 And find delight writ there with beauty's pen.
786 Examine every married lineament
787 And see how one another lends content,
788 And what obscured in this fair volume lies
789 Find written in the margent of his eyes.
790 This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
791 To beautify him only lacks a cover.
792 The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
793 For fair without the fair within to hide.
794 That book in many's eyes doth share the glory
795 That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.
796 So shall you share all that he doth possess
797 By having him, making yourself no less.
798 
799 NURSE
800 No less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.
801 
802 LADY CAPULET
803 Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris' love?
804 
805 JULIET
806 I'll look to like, if looking liking move.
807 But no more deep will I endart mine eye
808 Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
809 
810 [Enter Servingman.]
811 
812 
813 SERVINGMAN  Madam, the guests are come, supper
814 served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the
815 Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in
816 extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you,
817 follow straight.
818 
819 LADY CAPULET
820 We follow thee.	[Servingman exits.]
821 Juliet, the County stays.
822 
823 NURSE
824 Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
825 [They exit.]
826 
827 Scene 4
828 =======
829 [Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other
830 Maskers, Torchbearers, and a Boy with a drum.]
831 
832 
833 ROMEO
834 What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
835 Or shall we on without apology?
836 
837 BENVOLIO
838 The date is out of such prolixity.
839 We'll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,
840 Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
841 Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper,
842 Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
843 After the prompter, for our entrance.
844 But let them measure us by what they will.
845 We'll measure them a measure and be gone.
846 
847 ROMEO
848 Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
849 Being but heavy I will bear the light.
850 
851 MERCUTIO
852 Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
853 
854 ROMEO
855 Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
856 With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead
857 So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
858 
859 MERCUTIO
860 You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
861 And soar with them above a common bound.
862 
863 ROMEO
864 I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
865 To soar with his light feathers, and so bound
866 I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
867 Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
868 
869 MERCUTIO
870 And to sink in it should you burden love--
871 Too great oppression for a tender thing.
872 
873 ROMEO
874 Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
875 Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
876 
877 MERCUTIO
878 If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
879 Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.--
880 Give me a case to put my visage in.--
881 A visor for a visor. What care I
882 What curious eye doth cote deformities?
883 Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
884 
885 BENVOLIO
886 Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in
887 But every man betake him to his legs.
888 
889 ROMEO
890 A torch for me. Let wantons light of heart
891 Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
892 For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase:
893 I'll be a candle holder and look on;
894 The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
895 
896 MERCUTIO
897 Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word.
898 If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire--
899 Or, save your reverence, love--wherein thou
900 stickest
901 Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
902 
903 ROMEO
904 Nay, that's not so.
905 
906 MERCUTIO  I mean, sir, in delay
907 We waste our lights; in vain, light lights by day.
908 Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
909 Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
910 
911 ROMEO
912 And we mean well in going to this masque,
913 But 'tis no wit to go.
914 
915 MERCUTIO  Why, may one ask?
916 
917 ROMEO
918 I dreamt a dream tonight.
919 
920 MERCUTIO  And so did I.
921 
922 ROMEO
923 Well, what was yours?
924 
925 MERCUTIO  That dreamers often lie.
926 
927 ROMEO
928 In bed asleep while they do dream things true.
929 
930 MERCUTIO
931 O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
932 She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
933 In shape no bigger than an agate stone
934 On the forefinger of an alderman,
935 Drawn with a team of little atomi
936 Over men's noses as they lie asleep.
937 Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
938 The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
939 Her traces of the smallest spider web,
940 Her collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams,
941 Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
942 Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,
943 Not half so big as a round little worm
944 Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.
945 Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
946 Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
947 Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
948 And in this state she gallops night by night
949 Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
950 On courtiers' knees, that dream on cur'sies straight;
951 O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
952 O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
953 Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
954 Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
955 Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
956 And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.
957 And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
958 Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep;
959 Then he dreams of another benefice.
960 Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
961 And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
962 Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
963 Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon
964 Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes
965 And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
966 And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
967 That plats the manes of horses in the night
968 And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
969 Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.
970 This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
971 That presses them and learns them first to bear,
972 Making them women of good carriage.
973 This is she--
974 
975 ROMEO  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.
976 Thou talk'st of nothing.
977 
978 MERCUTIO  True, I talk of dreams,
979 Which are the children of an idle brain,
980 Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
981 Which is as thin of substance as the air
982 And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
983 Even now the frozen bosom of the north
984 And, being angered, puffs away from thence,
985 Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
986 
987 BENVOLIO
988 This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
989 Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
990 
991 ROMEO
992 I fear too early, for my mind misgives
993 Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
994 Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
995 With this night's revels, and expire the term
996 Of a despised life closed in my breast
997 By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
998 But he that hath the steerage of my course
999 Direct my sail. On, lusty gentlemen.
1000 
1001 BENVOLIO  Strike, drum.
1002 [They march about the stage
1003 and then withdraw to the side.]

1005 Scene 5
1006 =======
1007 [Servingmen come forth with napkins.]
1008 
1009 
1010 FIRST SERVINGMAN  Where's Potpan that he helps not
1011 to take away? He shift a trencher? He scrape a
1012 trencher?
1013 
1014 SECOND SERVINGMAN  When good manners shall lie
1015 all in one or two men's hands, and they unwashed
1016 too, 'tis a foul thing.
1017 
1018 FIRST SERVINGMAN  Away with the joint stools, remove
1019 the court cupboard, look to the plate.--
1020 Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as
1021 thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone
1022 and Nell.--Anthony and Potpan!
1023 
1024 THIRD SERVINGMAN  Ay, boy, ready.
1025 
1026 FIRST SERVINGMAN  You are looked for and called for,
1027 asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.
1028 
1029 THIRD SERVINGMAN  We cannot be here and there too.
1030 Cheerly, boys! Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver
1031 take all.	[They move aside.]
1032 
1033 [Enter Capulet and his household, all the guests and
1034 gentlewomen to Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, and the
1035 other Maskers.]
1036 
1037 
1038 CAPULET
1039 Welcome, gentlemen. Ladies that have their toes
1040 Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with
1041 you.--
1042 Ah, my mistresses, which of you all
1043 Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
1044 She, I'll swear, hath corns. Am I come near you
1045 now?--
1046 Welcome, gentlemen. I have seen the day
1047 That I have worn a visor and could tell
1048 A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
1049 Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.
1050 You are welcome, gentlemen.--Come, musicians,
1051 play.	[Music plays and they dance.]
1052 A hall, a hall, give room!--And foot it, girls.--
1053 More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,
1054 And quench the fire; the room is grown too hot.--
1055 Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.--
1056 Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
1057 For you and I are past our dancing days.
1058 How long is 't now since last yourself and I
1059 Were in a mask?
1060 
1061 CAPULET'S COUSIN  By 'r Lady, thirty years.
1062 
1063 CAPULET
1064 What, man, 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much.
1065 'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
1066 Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
1067 Some five and twenty years, and then we masked.
1068 
1069 CAPULET'S COUSIN
1070 'Tis more, 'tis more. His son is elder, sir.
1071 His son is thirty.
1072 
1073 CAPULET  Will you tell me that?
1074 His son was but a ward two years ago.
1075 
1076 ROMEO, [to a Servingman]
1077 What lady's that which doth enrich the hand
1078 Of yonder knight?
1079 
1080 SERVINGMAN  I know not, sir.
1081 
1082 ROMEO
1083 O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
1084 It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
1085 As a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear--
1086 Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.
1087 So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
1088 As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1089 The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
1090 And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1091 Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,
1092 For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
1093 
1094 TYBALT
1095 This, by his voice, should be a Montague.--
1096 Fetch me my rapier, boy.	[Page exits.]
1097 What, dares the slave
1098 Come hither covered with an antic face
1099 To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
1100 Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,
1101 To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
1102 
1103 CAPULET
1104 Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
1105 
1106 TYBALT
1107 Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
1108 A villain that is hither come in spite
1109 To scorn at our solemnity this night.
1110 
1111 CAPULET
1112 Young Romeo is it?
1113 
1114 TYBALT  'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
1115 
1116 CAPULET
1117 Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone.
1118 He bears him like a portly gentleman,
1119 And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
1120 To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
1121 I would not for the wealth of all this town
1122 Here in my house do him disparagement.
1123 Therefore be patient. Take no note of him.
1124 It is my will, the which if thou respect,
1125 Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
1126 An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
1127 
1128 TYBALT
1129 It fits when such a villain is a guest.
1130 I'll not endure him.
1131 
1132 CAPULET  He shall be endured.
1133 What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to.
1134 Am I the master here or you? Go to.
1135 You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
1136 You'll make a mutiny among my guests,
1137 You will set cock-a-hoop, you'll be the man!
1138 
1139 TYBALT
1140 Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
1141 
1142 CAPULET  Go to, go to.
1143 You are a saucy boy. Is 't so indeed?
1144 This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
1145 You must contrary me. Marry, 'tis time--
1146 Well said, my hearts.--You are a princox, go.
1147 Be quiet, or--More light, more light!--for shame,
1148 I'll make you quiet.--What, cheerly, my hearts!
1149 
1150 TYBALT
1151 Patience perforce with willful choler meeting
1152 Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
1153 I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,
1154 Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.

1156 
1157 ROMEO, [taking Juliet's hand]
1158 If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1159 This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:
1160 My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1161 To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
1162 
1163 JULIET
1164 Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1165 Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1166 For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1167 And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
1168 
1169 ROMEO
1170 Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
1171 
1172 JULIET
1173 Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
1174 
1175 ROMEO
1176 O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.
1177 They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
1178 
1179 JULIET
1180 Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
1181 
1182 ROMEO
1183 Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
1184 [He kisses her.]
1185 Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.
1186 
1187 JULIET
1188 Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
1189 
1190 ROMEO
1191 Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
1192 Give me my sin again.	[He kisses her.]
1193

1196 NURSE
1197 Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
1198 [Juliet moves toward her mother.]
1199 
1200 ROMEO
1201 What is her mother?
1202 
1203 NURSE  Marry, bachelor,
1204 Her mother is the lady of the house,
1205 And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
1206 I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.
1207 I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
1208 Shall have the chinks.	[Nurse moves away.]
1209 
1210 ROMEO, [aside]  Is she a Capulet?
1211 O dear account! My life is my foe's debt.
1212 
1213 BENVOLIO
1214 Away, begone. The sport is at the best.
1215 
1216 ROMEO
1217 Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.
1218 
1219 CAPULET
1220 Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.
1221 We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.--
1222 Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
1223 I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.--
1224 More torches here.--Come on then, let's to bed.--
1225 Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.
1226 I'll to my rest.
1227 [All but Juliet and the Nurse begin to exit.]
1228 
1229 JULIET
1230 Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1231 
1232 NURSE
1233 The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1234 
1235 JULIET
1236 What's he that now is going out of door?
1237 
1238 NURSE
1239 Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
1240 
1241 JULIET
1242 What's he that follows here, that would not dance?
1243 
1244 NURSE  I know not.
1245 
1246 JULIET
1247 Go ask his name. [The Nurse goes.] If he be married,
1248 My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1249 
1250 NURSE, [returning]
1251 His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
1252 The only son of your great enemy.
1253 
1254 JULIET
1255 My only love sprung from my only hate!
1256 Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1257 Prodigious birth of love it is to me
1258 That I must love a loathed enemy.
1259 
1260 NURSE
1261 What's this? What's this?
1262 
1263 JULIET  A rhyme I learned even now
1264 Of one I danced withal.
1265 [One calls within "Juliet."]
1266 
1267 NURSE  Anon, anon.
1268 Come, let's away. The strangers all are gone.
1269 [They exit.]

1272 ACT 2
1273 =====
1274 
1275 
1276 
1277 [Enter Chorus.]
1278 
1279 
1280 Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
1281 And young affection gapes to be his heir.
1282 That fair for which love groaned for and would die,
1283 With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.
1284 Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1285 Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,
1286 But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1287 And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
1288 Being held a foe, he may not have access
1289 To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
1290 And she as much in love, her means much less
1291 To meet her new beloved anywhere.
1292 But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
1293 Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
1294 [Chorus exits.]
1295 
1296 Scene 1
1297 =======
1298 [Enter Romeo alone.]
1299 
1300 
1301 ROMEO
1302 Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1303 Turn back, dull earth, and find thy center out.
1304 [He withdraws.]
1305 
1306 [Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.]
1307 
1308 BENVOLIO
1309 Romeo, my cousin Romeo, Romeo!
1310 
1311 MERCUTIO  He is wise
1312 And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1313 
1314 BENVOLIO
1315 He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.
1316 Call, good Mercutio.
1317 
1318 MERCUTIO  Nay, I'll conjure too.
1319 Romeo! Humors! Madman! Passion! Lover!
1320 Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.
1321 Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied.
1322 Cry but "Ay me," pronounce but "love" and
1323 "dove."
1324 Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1325 One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
1326 Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
1327 When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.--
1328 He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.
1329 The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--
1330 I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1331 By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,
1332 By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
1333 And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1334 That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
1335 
1336 BENVOLIO
1337 An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1338 
1339 MERCUTIO
1340 This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
1341 To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1342 Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1343 Till she had laid it and conjured it down.
1344 That were some spite. My invocation
1345 Is fair and honest. In his mistress' name,
1346 I conjure only but to raise up him.
1347 
1348 BENVOLIO
1349 Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
1350 To be consorted with the humorous night.
1351 Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1352 
1353 MERCUTIO
1354 If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1355 Now will he sit under a medlar tree
1356 And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1357 As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.--
1358 O Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1359 An open-arse, thou a pop'rin pear.
1360 Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle bed;
1361 This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.--
1362 Come, shall we go?
1363 
1364 BENVOLIO  Go, then, for 'tis in vain
1365 To seek him here that means not to be found.
1366 [They exit.]
1367 
1368 Scene 2
1369 =======
1370 [Romeo comes forward.]
1371 
1372 
1373 
1374 ROMEO
1375 He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1376 
1377 [Enter Juliet above.]
1378 
1379 But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
1380 It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.
1381 Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1382 Who is already sick and pale with grief
1383 That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
1384 Be not her maid since she is envious.
1385 Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
1386 And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
1387 It is my lady. O, it is my love!
1388 O, that she knew she were!
1389 She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
1390 Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1391 I am too bold. 'Tis not to me she speaks.
1392 Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1393 Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1394 To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1395 What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1396 The brightness of her cheek would shame those
1397 stars
1398 As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven
1399 Would through the airy region stream so bright
1400 That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1401 See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
1402 O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1403 That I might touch that cheek!
1404 
1405 JULIET  Ay me.
1406 
1407 ROMEO, [aside]  She speaks.
1408 O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art
1409 As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
1410 As is a winged messenger of heaven
1411 Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
1412 Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1413 When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds
1414 And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1415 
1416 JULIET
1417 O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
1418 Deny thy father and refuse thy name,
1419 Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1420 And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1421 
1422 ROMEO, [aside]
1423 Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1424 
1425 JULIET
1426 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
1427 Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1428 What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
1429 Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name
1430 Belonging to a man.
1431 What's in a name? That which we call a rose
1432 By any other word would smell as sweet.
1433 So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
1434 Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1435 Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1436 And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,
1437 Take all myself.
1438 
1439 ROMEO  I take thee at thy word.
1440 Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.
1441 Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1442 
1443 JULIET
1444 What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,
1445 So stumblest on my counsel?
1446 
1447 ROMEO  By a name
1448 I know not how to tell thee who I am.
1449 My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
1450 Because it is an enemy to thee.
1451 Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1452 
1453 JULIET
1454 My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
1455 Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.
1456 Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
1457 
1458 ROMEO
1459 Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
1460 
1461 JULIET
1462 How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1463 The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1464 And the place death, considering who thou art,
1465 If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1466 
1467 ROMEO
1468 With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls,
1469 For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1470 And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
1471 Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
1472 
1473 JULIET
1474 If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1475 
1476 ROMEO
1477 Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1478 Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
1479 And I am proof against their enmity.
1480 
1481 JULIET
1482 I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1483 
1484 ROMEO
1485 I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes,
1486 And, but thou love me, let them find me here.
1487 My life were better ended by their hate
1488 Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1489 
1490 JULIET
1491 By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1492 
1493 ROMEO
1494 By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
1495 He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
1496 I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1497 As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
1498 I should adventure for such merchandise.
1499 
1500 JULIET
1501 Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
1502 Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1503 For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
1504 Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny
1505 What I have spoke. But farewell compliment.
1506 Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Ay,"
1507 And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
1508 Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
1509 They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1510 If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
1511 Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
1512 I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
1513 So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.
1514 In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1515 And therefore thou mayst think my havior light.
1516 But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1517 Than those that have more coying to be strange.
1518 I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1519 But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware
1520 My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
1521 And not impute this yielding to light love,
1522 Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1523 
1524 ROMEO
1525 Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
1526 That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1527 
1528 JULIET
1529 O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
1530 That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1531 Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1532 
1533 ROMEO
1534 What shall I swear by?
1535 
1536 JULIET  Do not swear at all.
1537 Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1538 Which is the god of my idolatry,
1539 And I'll believe thee.
1540 
1541 ROMEO  If my heart's dear love--
1542 
1543 JULIET
1544 Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
1545 I have no joy of this contract tonight.
1546 It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,
1547 Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1548 Ere one can say "It lightens." Sweet, good night.
1549 This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1550 May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1551 Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
1552 Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
1553 
1554 ROMEO
1555 O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1556 
1557 JULIET
1558 What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
1559 
1560 ROMEO
1561 Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1562 
1563 JULIET
1564 I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,
1565 And yet I would it were to give again.
1566 
1567 ROMEO
1568 Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
1569 
1570 JULIET
1571 But to be frank and give it thee again.
1572 And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
1573 My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1574 My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
1575 The more I have, for both are infinite.
1576 [Nurse calls from within.]
1577 I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.--
1578 Anon, good nurse.--Sweet Montague, be true.
1579 Stay but a little; I will come again.	[She exits.]
1580 
1581 ROMEO
1582 O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
1583 Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1584 Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
1585 
1586 [Reenter Juliet above.]
1587 
1588 
1589 JULIET
1590 Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1591 If that thy bent of love be honorable,
1592 Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
1593 By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1594 Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
1595 And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1596 And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1597 
1598 NURSE, [within]  Madam.
1599 
1600 JULIET
1601 I come anon.--But if thou meanest not well,
1602 I do beseech thee--
1603 
1604 NURSE, [within]  Madam.
1605 
1606 JULIET  By and by, I come.--
1607 To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
1608 Tomorrow will I send.
1609 
1610 ROMEO  So thrive my soul--
1611 
1612 JULIET  A thousand times good night.	[She exits.]
1613 
1614 ROMEO
1615 A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
1616 Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their
1617 books,
1618 But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1619 [Going.]
1620 
1621 [Enter Juliet above again.]
1622 
1623 
1624 JULIET
1625 Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc'ner's voice
1626 To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1627 Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
1628 Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
1629 And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
1630 With repetition of "My Romeo!"
1631 
1632 ROMEO
1633 It is my soul that calls upon my name.
1634 How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1635 Like softest music to attending ears.
1636 
1637 JULIET
1638 Romeo.
1639 
1640 ROMEO  My dear.
1641 
1642 JULIET  What o'clock tomorrow
1643 Shall I send to thee?
1644 
1645 ROMEO  By the hour of nine.
1646 
1647 JULIET
1648 I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.
1649 I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1650 
1651 ROMEO
1652 Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1653 
1654 JULIET
1655 I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1656 Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
1657 
1658 ROMEO
1659 And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1660 Forgetting any other home but this.
1661 
1662 JULIET
1663 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone,
1664 And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
1665 That lets it hop a little from his hand,
1666 Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1667 And with a silken thread plucks it back again,
1668 So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1669 
1670 ROMEO
1671 I would I were thy bird.
1672 
1673 JULIET  Sweet, so would I.
1674 Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1675 Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet
1676 sorrow
1677 That I shall say "Good night" till it be morrow.
1678 [She exits.]
1679 
1680 ROMEO
1681 Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
1682 Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.
1683 Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell,
1684 His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1685 [He exits.]
1686 
1687 Scene 3
1688 =======
1689 [Enter Friar Lawrence alone with a basket.]
1690 
1691 
1692 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1693 The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1694 Check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1695 And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
1696 From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
1697 Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1698 The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1699 I must upfill this osier cage of ours
1700 With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1701 The Earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1702 What is her burying grave, that is her womb;
1703 And from her womb children of divers kind
1704 We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1705 Many for many virtues excellent,
1706 None but for some, and yet all different.
1707 O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1708 In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
1709 For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live
1710 But to the Earth some special good doth give;
1711 Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,
1712 Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
1713 Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
1714 And vice sometime by action dignified.
1715 
1716 [Enter Romeo.]
1717 
1718 Within the infant rind of this weak flower
1719 Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1720 For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each
1721 part;
1722 Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.
1723 Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1724 In man as well as herbs--grace and rude will;
1725 And where the worser is predominant,
1726 Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1727 
1728 ROMEO
1729 Good morrow, father.
1730 
1731 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Benedicite.
1732 What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1733 Young son, it argues a distempered head
1734 So soon to bid "Good morrow" to thy bed.
1735 Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1736 And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1737 But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain
1738 Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth
1739 reign.
1740 Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1741 Thou art uproused with some distemp'rature,
1742 Or, if not so, then here I hit it right:
1743 Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
1744 
1745 ROMEO
1746 That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.
1747 
1748 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1749 God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
1750 
1751 ROMEO
1752 With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
1753 I have forgot that name and that name's woe.
1754 
1755 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1756 That's my good son. But where hast thou been
1757 then?
1758 
1759 ROMEO
1760 I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
1761 I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1762 Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
1763 That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
1764 Within thy help and holy physic lies.
1765 I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1766 My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1767 
1768 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1769 Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.
1770 Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1771 
1772 ROMEO
1773 Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1774 On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
1775 As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
1776 And all combined, save what thou must combine
1777 By holy marriage. When and where and how
1778 We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow
1779 I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,
1780 That thou consent to marry us today.
1781 
1782 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1783 Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1784 Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
1785 So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
1786 Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1787 Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1788 Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1789 How much salt water thrown away in waste
1790 To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1791 The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1792 Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.
1793 Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1794 Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.
1795 If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
1796 Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
1797 And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence
1798 then:
1799 Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
1800 
1801 ROMEO
1802 Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1803 
1804 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1805 For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1806 
1807 ROMEO
1808 And bad'st me bury love.
1809 
1810 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Not in a grave
1811 To lay one in, another out to have.
1812 
1813 ROMEO
1814 I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now
1815 Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
1816 The other did not so.
1817 
1818 FRIAR LAWRENCE  O, she knew well
1819 Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
1820 But come, young waverer, come, go with me.
1821 In one respect I'll thy assistant be,
1822 For this alliance may so happy prove
1823 To turn your households' rancor to pure love.
1824 
1825 ROMEO
1826 O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.
1827 
1828 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1829 Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.

1832 Scene 4
1833 =======
1834 [Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]
1835 
1836 
1837 MERCUTIO
1838 Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1839 Came he not home tonight?
1840 
1841 BENVOLIO
1842 Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
1843 
1844 MERCUTIO
1845 Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that
1846 Rosaline,
1847 Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
1848 
1849 BENVOLIO
1850 Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
1851 Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1852 
1853 MERCUTIO  A challenge, on my life.
1854 
1855 BENVOLIO  Romeo will answer it.
1856 
1857 MERCUTIO  Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1858 
1859 BENVOLIO  Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how
1860 he dares, being dared.
1861 
1862 MERCUTIO  Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead,
1863 stabbed with a white wench's black eye, run
1864 through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his
1865 heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt shaft. And
1866 is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
1867 
1868 BENVOLIO  Why, what is Tybalt?
1869 
1870 MERCUTIO  More than prince of cats. O, he's the courageous
1871 captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
1872 prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.
1873 He rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in
1874 your bosom--the very butcher of a silk button, a
1875 duelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house
1876 of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal
1877 passado, the punto reverso, the hay!
1878 
1879 BENVOLIO  The what?
1880 
1881 MERCUTIO  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1882 phantasimes, these new tuners of accent: "By
1883 Jesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good
1884 whore!" Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire,
1885 that we should be thus afflicted with these
1886 strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these "pardon-me" 's,
1887 who stand so much on the new form
1888 that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O their
1889 bones, their bones!
1890 
1891 [Enter Romeo.]
1892 
1893 
1894 BENVOLIO  Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1895 
1896 MERCUTIO  Without his roe, like a dried herring. O
1897 flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the
1898 numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura to his lady
1899 was a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love
1900 to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
1901 Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a gray
1902 eye or so, but not to the purpose.--Signior Romeo,
1903 bonjour. There's a French salutation to your French
1904 slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
1905 
1906 ROMEO  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit
1907 did I give you?
1908 
1909 MERCUTIO  The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
1910 
1911 ROMEO  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was
1912 great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain
1913 courtesy.
1914 
1915 MERCUTIO  That's as much as to say such a case as
1916 yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1917 
1918 ROMEO  Meaning, to curtsy.
1919 
1920 MERCUTIO  Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1921 
1922 ROMEO  A most courteous exposition.
1923 
1924 MERCUTIO  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1925 
1926 ROMEO  "Pink" for flower.
1927 
1928 MERCUTIO  Right.
1929 
1930 ROMEO  Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1931 
1932 MERCUTIO  Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou
1933 hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole
1934 of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing,
1935 solely singular.
1936 
1937 ROMEO  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1938 singleness.
1939 
1940 MERCUTIO  Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits
1941 faints.
1942 
1943 ROMEO  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry
1944 a match.
1945 
1946 MERCUTIO  Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I
1947 am done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in
1948 one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole
1949 five. Was I with you there for the goose?
1950 
1951 ROMEO  Thou wast never with me for anything when
1952 thou wast not there for the goose.
1953 
1954 MERCUTIO  I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1955 
1956 ROMEO  Nay, good goose, bite not.
1957 
1958 MERCUTIO  Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1959 sharp sauce.
1960 
1961 ROMEO  And is it not, then, well served into a sweet
1962 goose?
1963 
1964 MERCUTIO  O, here's a wit of cheveril that stretches
1965 from an inch narrow to an ell broad.
1966 
1967 ROMEO  I stretch it out for that word "broad," which
1968 added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a
1969 broad goose.
1970 
1971 MERCUTIO  Why, is not this better now than groaning
1972 for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou
1973 Romeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as
1974 by nature. For this driveling love is like a great
1975 natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his
1976 bauble in a hole.
1977 
1978 BENVOLIO  Stop there, stop there.
1979 
1980 MERCUTIO  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against
1981 the hair.
1982 
1983 BENVOLIO  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1984 
1985 MERCUTIO  O, thou art deceived. I would have made it
1986 short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale
1987 and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
1988 longer.
1989 
1990 [Enter Nurse and her man Peter.]
1991 
1992 
1993 ROMEO  Here's goodly gear. A sail, a sail!
1994 
1995 MERCUTIO  Two, two--a shirt and a smock.
1996 
1997 NURSE  Peter.
1998 
1999 PETER  Anon.
2000 
2001 NURSE  My fan, Peter.
2002 
2003 MERCUTIO  Good Peter, to hide her face, for her fan's
2004 the fairer face.
2005 
2006 NURSE  God you good morrow, gentlemen.
2007 
2008 MERCUTIO  God you good e'en, fair gentlewoman.
2009 
2010 NURSE  Is it good e'en?
2011 
2012 MERCUTIO  'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of
2013 the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
2014 
2015 NURSE  Out upon you! What a man are you?
2016 
2017 ROMEO  One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself
2018 to mar.
2019 
2020 NURSE  By my troth, it is well said: "for himself to
2021 mar," quoth he? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me
2022 where I may find the young Romeo?
2023 
2024 ROMEO  I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older
2025 when you have found him than he was when you
2026 sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for
2027 fault of a worse.
2028 
2029 NURSE  You say well.
2030 
2031 MERCUTIO  Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i'
2032 faith, wisely, wisely.
2033 
2034 NURSE  If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
2035 you.
2036 
2037 BENVOLIO  She will indite him to some supper.
2038 
2039 MERCUTIO  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd. So ho!
2040 
2041 ROMEO  What hast thou found?
2042 
2043 MERCUTIO  No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten
2044 pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
2045 [Singing.]	An old hare hoar,
2046 	And an old hare hoar,
2047 	   Is very good meat in Lent.
2048 	But a hare that is hoar
2049 	Is too much for a score
2050 	   When it hoars ere it be spent.
2051 Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to
2052 dinner thither.
2053 
2054 ROMEO  I will follow you.
2055 
2056 MERCUTIO  Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell, lady, lady,
2057 lady.	[Mercutio and Benvolio exit.]
2058 
2059 NURSE  I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this
2060 that was so full of his ropery?
2061 
2062 ROMEO  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself
2063 talk and will speak more in a minute than he will
2064 stand to in a month.
2065 
2066 NURSE  An he speak anything against me, I'll take him
2067 down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty
2068 such jacks. An if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
2069 Scurvy knave, I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none
2070 of his skains-mates. [To Peter.] And thou must stand
2071 by too and suffer every knave to use me at his
2072 pleasure.
2073 
2074 PETER  I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had,
2075 my weapon should quickly have been out. I warrant
2076 you, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I
2077 see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my
2078 side.
2079 
2080 NURSE  Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part
2081 about me quivers. Scurvy knave! [To Romeo.] Pray
2082 you, sir, a word. And, as I told you, my young lady
2083 bid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will
2084 keep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you
2085 should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it
2086 were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For
2087 the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you
2088 should deal double with her, truly it were an ill
2089 thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very
2090 weak dealing.
2091 
2092 ROMEO  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.
2093 I protest unto thee--
2094 
2095 NURSE  Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much.
2096 Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
2097 
2098 ROMEO  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not
2099 mark me.
2100 
2101 NURSE  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as
2102 I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2103 
2104 ROMEO  Bid her devise
2105 Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
2106 And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell
2107 Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
2108 [Offering her money.]
2109 
2110 NURSE  No, truly, sir, not a penny.
2111 
2112 ROMEO  Go to, I say you shall.
2113 
2114 NURSE
2115 This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
2116 
2117 ROMEO
2118 And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
2119 Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2120 And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
2121 Which to the high topgallant of my joy
2122 Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2123 Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
2124 Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
2125 
2126 NURSE
2127 Now, God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2128 
2129 ROMEO  What sayst thou, my dear nurse?
2130 
2131 NURSE
2132 Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say
2133 "Two may keep counsel, putting one away"?
2134 
2135 ROMEO
2136 Warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
2137 
2138 NURSE  Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord,
2139 Lord, when 'twas a little prating thing--O, there is
2140 a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay
2141 knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a
2142 toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes
2143 and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I'll
2144 warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
2145 clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
2146 Romeo begin both with a letter?
2147 
2148 ROMEO  Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.
2149 
2150 NURSE  Ah, mocker, that's the dog's name. R is for
2151 the--No, I know it begins with some other letter,
2152 and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you
2153 and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.
2154 
2155 ROMEO  Commend me to thy lady.
2156 
2157 NURSE  Ay, a thousand times.--Peter.

2168 
2169 JULIET
2170 The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.
2171 In half an hour she promised to return.
2172 Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
2173 O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
2174 Which ten times faster glides than the sun's beams,
2175 Driving back shadows over louring hills.
2176 Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,
2177 And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2178 Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2179 Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2180 Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
2181 Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2182 She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2183 My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2184 And his to me.
2185 But old folks, many feign as they were dead,
2186 Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
2187 
2188 [Enter Nurse and Peter.]
2189 
2190 O God, she comes!--O, honey nurse, what news?
2191 Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2192 
2193 NURSE  Peter, stay at the gate.	[Peter exits.]
2194 
2195 JULIET
2196 Now, good sweet nurse--O Lord, why lookest thou
2197 sad?
2198 Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.
2199 If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2200 By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2201 
2202 NURSE
2203 I am aweary. Give me leave awhile.
2204 Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!
2205 
2206 JULIET
2207 I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
2208 Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,
2209 speak.
2210 
2211 NURSE
2212 Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
2213 Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2214 
2215 JULIET
2216 How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2217 To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2218 The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2219 Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2220 Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
2221 Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
2222 Let me be satisfied; is 't good or bad?
2223 
2224 NURSE  Well, you have made a simple choice. You know
2225 not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he.
2226 Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg
2227 excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a
2228 body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they
2229 are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy,
2230 but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
2231 ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at
2232 home?
2233 
2234 JULIET
2235 No, no. But all this did I know before.
2236 What says he of our marriage? What of that?
2237 
2238 NURSE
2239 Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
2240 It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2241 My back o' t' other side! Ah, my back, my back!
2242 Beshrew your heart for sending me about
2243 To catch my death with jaunting up and down.
2244 
2245 JULIET
2246 I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2247 Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my
2248 love?
2249 
2250 NURSE  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
2251 courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
2252 warrant, a virtuous--Where is your mother?
2253 
2254 JULIET
2255 Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
2256 Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:
2257 "Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2258 Where is your mother?"
2259 
2260 NURSE  O God's lady dear,
2261 Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.
2262 Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2263 Henceforward do your messages yourself.
2264 
2265 JULIET
2266 Here's such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
2267 
2268 NURSE
2269 Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
2270 
2271 JULIET  I have.
2272 
2273 NURSE
2274 Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell.
2275 There stays a husband to make you a wife.
2276 Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks;
2277 They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2278 Hie you to church. I must another way,
2279 To fetch a ladder by the which your love
2280 Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
2281 I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
2282 But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
2283 Go. I'll to dinner. Hie you to the cell.
2284

2286 Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

2295 So smile the heavens upon this holy act
2296 That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
2297 
2298 ROMEO
2299 Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,
2300 It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2301 That one short minute gives me in her sight.
2302 Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2303 Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
2304 It is enough I may but call her mine.

2308 And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2309 Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
2310 Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2311 And in the taste confounds the appetite.
2312 Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so.
2313 Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2314 
2315 [Enter Juliet.]
2316 
2317 Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
2318 Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
2319 A lover may bestride the gossamers
2320 That idles in the wanton summer air,
2321 And yet not fall, so light is vanity.
2322 
2323 JULIET
2324 Good even to my ghostly confessor.
2325 
2326 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2327 Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2328 
2329 JULIET
2330 As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2331 
2332 ROMEO
2333 Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2334 Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more
2335 To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2336 This neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue
2337 Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2338 Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2339 
2340 JULIET
2341 Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2342 Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
2343 They are but beggars that can count their worth,
2344 But my true love is grown to such excess
2345 I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2346 
2347 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2348 Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
2349 For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2350 Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
2351 [They exit.]

2354 ACT 3
2355 =====
2356 
2357 Scene 1
2358 =======
2359 [Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and their men.]
2360 
2361 
2362 BENVOLIO
2363 I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
2364 The day is hot, the Capels are abroad,
2365 And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl,
2366 For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2367 
2368 MERCUTIO  Thou art like one of these fellows that, when
2369 he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his
2370 sword upon the table and says "God send me no
2371 need of thee" and, by the operation of the second
2372 cup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is
2373 no need.
2374 
2375 BENVOLIO  Am I like such a fellow?
2376 
2377 MERCUTIO  Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy
2378 mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be
2379 moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
2380 
2381 BENVOLIO  And what to?
2382 
2383 MERCUTIO  Nay, an there were two such, we should
2384 have none shortly, for one would kill the other.
2385 Thou--why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that
2386 hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than
2387 thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking
2388 nuts, having no other reason but because thou
2389 hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy
2390 out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as
2391 an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been
2392 beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast
2393 quarreled with a man for coughing in the street
2394 because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain
2395 asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor
2396 for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With
2397 another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?
2398 And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?
2399 
2400 BENVOLIO  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any
2401 man should buy the fee simple of my life for an
2402 hour and a quarter.
2403 
2404 MERCUTIO  The fee simple? O simple!
2405 
2406 [Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.]
2407 
2408 
2409 BENVOLIO  By my head, here comes the Capulets.
2410 
2411 MERCUTIO  By my heel, I care not.
2412 
2413 TYBALT, [to his companions]
2414 Follow me close, for I will speak to them.--
2415 Gentlemen, good e'en. A word with one of you.
2416 
2417 MERCUTIO  And but one word with one of us? Couple it
2418 with something. Make it a word and a blow.
2419 
2420 TYBALT  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an
2421 you will give me occasion.
2422 
2423 MERCUTIO  Could you not take some occasion without
2424 giving?
2425 
2426 TYBALT  Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
2427 
2428 MERCUTIO  Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?
2429 An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear
2430 nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick; here's
2431 that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
2432 
2433 BENVOLIO
2434 We talk here in the public haunt of men.
2435 Either withdraw unto some private place,
2436 Or reason coldly of your grievances,
2437 Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
2438 
2439 MERCUTIO
2440 Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
2441 I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2442 
2443 [Enter Romeo.]
2444 
2445 
2446 TYBALT
2447 Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
2448 
2449 MERCUTIO
2450 But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
2451 Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower.
2452 Your Worship in that sense may call him "man."
2453 
2454 TYBALT
2455 Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
2456 No better term than this: thou art a villain.
2457 
2458 ROMEO
2459 Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2460 Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2461 To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
2462 Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
2463 
2464 TYBALT
2465 Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2466 That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.
2467 
2468 ROMEO
2469 I do protest I never injured thee
2470 But love thee better than thou canst devise
2471 Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
2472 And so, good Capulet, which name I tender
2473 As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
2474 
2475 MERCUTIO
2476 O calm, dishonorable, vile submission!
2477 Alla stoccato carries it away.	[He draws.]
2478 Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
2479 
2480 TYBALT  What wouldst thou have with me?
2481 
2482 MERCUTIO  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your
2483 nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as
2484 you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the
2485 eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher
2486 by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
2487 ears ere it be out.
2488 
2489 TYBALT  I am for you.	[He draws.]
2490 
2491 ROMEO
2492 Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2493 
2494 MERCUTIO  Come, sir, your passado.	[They fight.]
2495 
2496 ROMEO
2497 Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.
2498 [Romeo draws.]
2499 Gentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage!
2500 Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath
2501 Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
2502 Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
2503 [Romeo attempts to beat down their rapiers.
2504 Tybalt stabs Mercutio.]
2505 
2506 PETRUCHIO  Away, Tybalt!
2507 [Tybalt, Petruchio, and their followers exit.]
2508 
2509 MERCUTIO  I am hurt.
2510 A plague o' both houses! I am sped.
2511 Is he gone and hath nothing?
2512 
2513 BENVOLIO  What, art thou hurt?
2514 
2515 MERCUTIO
2516 Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
2517 Where is my page?--Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2518 [Page exits.]
2519 
2520 ROMEO
2521 Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.
2522 
2523 MERCUTIO  No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as
2524 a church door, but 'tis enough. 'Twill serve. Ask for
2525 me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2526 am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2527 both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2528 cat, to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a
2529 villain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the
2530 devil came you between us? I was hurt under your
2531 arm.
2532 
2533 ROMEO  I thought all for the best.
2534 
2535 MERCUTIO
2536 Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2537 Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2538 They have made worms' meat of me.
2539 I have it, and soundly, too. Your houses!
2540 [All but Romeo exit.]
2541 
2542 ROMEO
2543 This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
2544 My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
2545 In my behalf. My reputation stained
2546 With Tybalt's slander--Tybalt, that an hour
2547 Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,
2548 Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2549 And in my temper softened valor's steel.
2550 
2551 [Enter Benvolio.]
2552 
2553 
2554 BENVOLIO
2555 O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.
2556 That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2557 Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2558 
2559 ROMEO
2560 This day's black fate on more days doth depend.
2561 This but begins the woe others must end.
2562 
2563 [Enter Tybalt.]
2564 
2565 
2566 BENVOLIO
2567 Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2568 
2569 ROMEO
2570 Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!
2571 Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2572 And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.--
2573 Now, Tybalt, take the "villain" back again
2574 That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio's soul
2575 Is but a little way above our heads,
2576 Staying for thine to keep him company.
2577 Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
2578 
2579 TYBALT
2580 Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
2581 Shalt with him hence.
2582 
2583 ROMEO  This shall determine that.
2584 [They fight. Tybalt falls.]
2585 
2586 BENVOLIO
2587 Romeo, away, begone!
2588 The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2589 Stand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death
2590 If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away.
2591 
2592 ROMEO
2593 O, I am Fortune's fool!
2594 
2595 BENVOLIO  Why dost thou stay?
2596 [Romeo exits.]
2597 
2598 [Enter Citizens.]
2599 
2600 
2601 CITIZEN
2602 Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?
2603 Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2604 
2605 BENVOLIO
2606 There lies that Tybalt.
2607 
2608 CITIZEN, [to Tybalt]  Up, sir, go with me.
2609 I charge thee in the Prince's name, obey.
2610 
2611 [Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their Wives and all.]
2612 
2613 
2614 PRINCE
2615 Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2616 
2617 BENVOLIO
2618 O noble prince, I can discover all
2619 The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
2620 There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2621 That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2622 
2623 LADY CAPULET
2624 Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child!
2625 O prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled
2626 Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2627 For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2628 O cousin, cousin!
2629 
2630 PRINCE
2631 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2632 
2633 BENVOLIO
2634 Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay--
2635 Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
2636 How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2637 Your high displeasure. All this uttered
2638 With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed
2639 Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2640 Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2641 With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2642 Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point
2643 And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2644 Cold death aside and with the other sends
2645 It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
2646 Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud
2647 "Hold, friends! Friends, part!" and swifter than his
2648 tongue
2649 His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2650 And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2651 An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2652 Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
2653 But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2654 Who had but newly entertained revenge,
2655 And to 't they go like lightning, for ere I
2656 Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,
2657 And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2658 This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2659 
2660 LADY CAPULET
2661 He is a kinsman to the Montague.
2662 Affection makes him false; he speaks not true.
2663 Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2664 And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2665 I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.
2666 Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
2667 
2668 PRINCE
2669 Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
2670 Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2671 
2672 MONTAGUE
2673 Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend.
2674 His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2675 The life of Tybalt.
2676 
2677 PRINCE  And for that offense
2678 Immediately we do exile him hence.
2679 I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding:
2680 My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
2681 But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2682 That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
2683 I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.
2684 Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
2685 Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
2686 Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
2687 Bear hence this body and attend our will.
2688 Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2689 [They exit, the Capulet men
2690 bearing off Tybalt's body.]
2691 
2692 Scene 2
2693 =======
2694 [Enter Juliet alone.]
2695 
2696 
2697 JULIET
2698 Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2699 Towards Phoebus' lodging. Such a wagoner
2700 As Phaeton would whip you to the west
2701 And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2702 Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2703 That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo
2704 Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.
2705 Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2706 By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,
2707 It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2708 Thou sober-suited matron all in black,
2709 And learn me how to lose a winning match
2710 Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
2711 Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,
2712 With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,
2713 Think true love acted simple modesty.
2714 Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in
2715 night,
2716 For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2717 Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
2718 Come, gentle night; come, loving black-browed
2719 night,
2720 Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
2721 Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2722 And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2723 That all the world will be in love with night
2724 And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2725 O, I have bought the mansion of a love
2726 But not possessed it, and, though I am sold,
2727 Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day
2728 As is the night before some festival
2729 To an impatient child that hath new robes
2730 And may not wear them.
2731 
2732 [Enter Nurse with cords.]
2733 
2734 O, here comes my nurse,
2735 And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
2736 But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--
2737 Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The
2738 cords
2739 That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2740 
2741 NURSE  Ay, ay, the cords.
2742 [Dropping the rope ladder.]
2743 
2744 JULIET
2745 Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
2746 
2747 NURSE
2748 Ah weraday, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2749 We are undone, lady, we are undone.
2750 Alack the day, he's gone, he's killed, he's dead.
2751 
2752 JULIET
2753 Can heaven be so envious?
2754 
2755 NURSE  Romeo can,
2756 Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo,
2757 Whoever would have thought it? Romeo!
2758 
2759 JULIET
2760 What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
2761 This torture should be roared in dismal hell.
2762 Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but "Ay,"
2763 And that bare vowel "I" shall poison more
2764 Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
2765 I am not I if there be such an "I,"
2766 Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "Ay."
2767 If he be slain, say "Ay," or if not, "No."
2768 Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.
2769 
2770 NURSE
2771 I saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes
2772 (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast--
2773 A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,
2774 Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,
2775 All in gore blood. I swooned at the sight.
2776 
2777 JULIET
2778 O break, my heart, poor bankrout, break at once!
2779 To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty.
2780 Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
2781 And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
2782 
2783 NURSE
2784 O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2785 O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,
2786 That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2787 
2788 JULIET
2789 What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2790 Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead?
2791 My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
2792 Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom,
2793 For who is living if those two are gone?
2794 
2795 NURSE
2796 Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished.
2797 Romeo that killed him--he is banished.
2798 
2799 JULIET
2800 O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2801 
2802 NURSE
2803 It did, it did, alas the day, it did.
2804 
2805 JULIET
2806 O serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face!
2807 Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2808 Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical!
2809 Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
2810 Despised substance of divinest show!
2811 Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2812 A damned saint, an honorable villain.
2813 O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
2814 When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2815 In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
2816 Was ever book containing such vile matter
2817 So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
2818 In such a gorgeous palace!
2819 
2820 NURSE  There's no trust,
2821 No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured,
2822 All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2823 Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
2824 These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me
2825 old.
2826 Shame come to Romeo!
2827 
2828 JULIET  Blistered be thy tongue
2829 For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
2830 Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,
2831 For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned
2832 Sole monarch of the universal Earth.
2833 O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2834 
2835 NURSE
2836 Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
2837 
2838 JULIET
2839 Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2840 Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy
2841 name
2842 When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2843 But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2844 That villain cousin would have killed my husband.
2845 Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2846 Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2847 Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2848 My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
2849 And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my
2850 husband.
2851 All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?
2852 Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2853 That murdered me. I would forget it fain,
2854 But, O, it presses to my memory
2855 Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2856 "Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished."
2857 That "banished," that one word "banished,"
2858 Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2859 Was woe enough if it had ended there;
2860 Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2861 And needly will be ranked with other griefs,
2862 Why followed not, when she said "Tybalt's dead,"
2863 "Thy father" or "thy mother," nay, or both,
2864 Which modern lamentation might have moved?
2865 But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
2866 "Romeo is banished." To speak that word
2867 Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2868 All slain, all dead. "Romeo is banished."
2869 There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2870 In that word's death. No words can that woe sound.
2871 Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
2872 
2873 NURSE
2874 Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
2875 Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2876 
2877 JULIET
2878 Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be
2879 spent,
2880 When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.--
2881 Take up those cords.
2882 [The Nurse picks up the rope ladder.]
2883 Poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2884 Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.
2885 He made you for a highway to my bed,
2886 But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2887 Come, cords--come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed,
2888 And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2889 
2890 NURSE
2891 Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
2892 To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
2893 Hark you, your Romeo will be here at night.
2894 I'll to him. He is hid at Lawrence' cell.
2895 
2896 JULIET
2897 O, find him!	[Giving the Nurse a ring.]
2898 Give this ring to my true knight
2899 And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2900 [They exit.]

2902 Scene 3
2903 =======
2904 [Enter Friar Lawrence.]
2905 
2906 
2907 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2908 Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
2909 Affliction is enamored of thy parts,
2910 And thou art wedded to calamity.
2911 
2912 [Enter Romeo.]
2913 
2914 
2915 ROMEO
2916 Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom?
2917 What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
2918 That I yet know not?
2919 
2920 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Too familiar
2921 Is my dear son with such sour company.
2922 I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
2923 
2924 ROMEO
2925 What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
2926 
2927 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2928 A gentler judgment vanished from his lips:
2929 Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2930 
2931 ROMEO
2932 Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say "death,"
2933 For exile hath more terror in his look,
2934 Much more than death. Do not say "banishment."
2935 
2936 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2937 Here from Verona art thou banished.
2938 Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2939 
2940 ROMEO
2941 There is no world without Verona walls
2942 But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2943 Hence "banished" is "banished from the world,"
2944 And world's exile is death. Then "banished"
2945 Is death mistermed. Calling death "banished,"
2946 Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax
2947 And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2948 
2949 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2950 O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
2951 Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,
2952 Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law
2953 And turned that black word "death" to
2954 "banishment."
2955 This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2956 
2957 ROMEO
2958 'Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here
2959 Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog
2960 And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2961 Live here in heaven and may look on her,
2962 But Romeo may not. More validity,
2963 More honorable state, more courtship lives
2964 In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
2965 On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2966 And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2967 Who even in pure and vestal modesty
2968 Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2969 But Romeo may not; he is banished.
2970 Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.
2971 They are free men, but I am banished.
2972 And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
2973 Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground
2974 knife,
2975 No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2976 But "banished" to kill me? "Banished"?
2977 O friar, the damned use that word in hell.
2978 Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
2979 Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2980 A sin absolver, and my friend professed,
2981 To mangle me with that word "banished"?
2982 
2983 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2984 Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
2985 
2986 ROMEO
2987 O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2988 
2989 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2990 I'll give thee armor to keep off that word,
2991 Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2992 To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2993 
2994 ROMEO
2995 Yet "banished"? Hang up philosophy.
2996 Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2997 Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2998 It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
2999 
3000 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3001 O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
3002 
3003 ROMEO
3004 How should they when that wise men have no eyes?
3005 
3006 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3007 Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
3008 
3009 ROMEO
3010 Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
3011 Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
3012 An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
3013 Doting like me, and like me banished,
3014 Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy
3015 hair
3016 And fall upon the ground as I do now,
3017 [Romeo throws himself down.]
3018 Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
3019 [Knock within.]
3020 
3021 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3022 Arise. One knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
3023 
3024 ROMEO
3025 Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,
3026 Mistlike, enfold me from the search of eyes.
3027 [Knock.]
3028 
3029 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3030 Hark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo,
3031 arise.
3032 Thou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile.--Stand up.
3033 [Knock.]
3034 Run to my study.--By and by.--God's will,
3035 What simpleness is this?--I come, I come.
3036 [Knock.]
3037 Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's
3038 your will?
3039 
3040 NURSE, [within]
3041 Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
3042 I come from Lady Juliet.
3043 
3044 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [admitting the Nurse]
3045 Welcome, then.
3046 
3047 [Enter Nurse.]
3048 
3049 
3050 NURSE
3051 O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
3052 Where's my lady's lord? Where's Romeo?
3053 
3054 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3055 There on the ground, with his own tears made
3056 drunk.
3057 
3058 NURSE
3059 O, he is even in my mistress' case,
3060 Just in her case. O woeful sympathy!
3061 Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
3062 Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubb'ring.--
3063 Stand up, stand up. Stand an you be a man.
3064 For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
3065 Why should you fall into so deep an O?
3066 
3067 ROMEO  Nurse.
3068 
3069 NURSE
3070 Ah sir, ah sir, death's the end of all.
3071 
3072 ROMEO, [rising up]
3073 Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
3074 Doth not she think me an old murderer,
3075 Now I have stained the childhood of our joy
3076 With blood removed but little from her own?
3077 Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
3078 My concealed lady to our canceled love?
3079 
3080 NURSE
3081 O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,
3082 And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
3083 And "Tybalt" calls, and then on Romeo cries,
3084 And then down falls again.
3085 
3086 ROMEO  As if that name,
3087 Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
3088 Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand
3089 Murdered her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,
3090 In what vile part of this anatomy
3091 Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
3092 The hateful mansion.	[He draws his dagger.]
3093 
3094 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Hold thy desperate hand!
3095 Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
3096 Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
3097 The unreasonable fury of a beast.
3098 Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
3099 And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
3100 Thou hast amazed me. By my holy order,
3101 I thought thy disposition better tempered.
3102 Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself,
3103 And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
3104 By doing damned hate upon thyself?
3105 Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth,
3106 Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
3107 In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?
3108 Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
3109 Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all
3110 And usest none in that true use indeed
3111 Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
3112 Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
3113 Digressing from the valor of a man;
3114 Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
3115 Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;
3116 Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
3117 Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
3118 Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
3119 Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
3120 And thou dismembered with thine own defense.
3121 What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
3122 For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead:
3123 There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
3124 But thou slewest Tybalt: there art thou happy.
3125 The law that threatened death becomes thy friend
3126 And turns it to exile: there art thou happy.
3127 A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
3128 Happiness courts thee in her best array;
3129 But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
3130 Thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love.
3131 Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
3132 Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.
3133 Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her.
3134 But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
3135 For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
3136 Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
3137 To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
3138 Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
3139 With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
3140 Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.--
3141 Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
3142 And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
3143 Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
3144 Romeo is coming.
3145 
3146 NURSE
3147 O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night
3148 To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!--
3149 My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
3150 
3151 ROMEO
3152 Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
3153 
3154 NURSE
3155 Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
3156 [Nurse gives Romeo a ring.]
3157 Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
3158 [She exits.]
3159 
3160 ROMEO
3161 How well my comfort is revived by this!
3162 
3163 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3164 Go hence, good night--and here stands all your
3165 state:
3166 Either be gone before the watch be set
3167 Or by the break of day disguised from hence.
3168 Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
3169 And he shall signify from time to time
3170 Every good hap to you that chances here.
3171 Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell. Good night.
3172 
3173 ROMEO
3174 But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
3175 It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
3176 Farewell.
3177 [They exit.]

3179 Scene 4
3180 =======
3181 [Enter old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.]
3182 
3183 
3184 CAPULET
3185 Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
3186 That we have had no time to move our daughter.
3187 Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
3188 And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
3189 'Tis very late. She'll not come down tonight.
3190 I promise you, but for your company,
3191 I would have been abed an hour ago.
3192 
3193 PARIS
3194 These times of woe afford no times to woo.--
3195 Madam, good night. Commend me to your
3196 daughter.
3197 
3198 LADY CAPULET
3199 I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.
3200 Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.
3201 
3202 CAPULET
3203 Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
3204 Of my child's love. I think she will be ruled
3205 In all respects by me. Nay, more, I doubt it not.--
3206 Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed.
3207 Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love,
3208 And bid her--mark you me?--on Wednesday
3209 next--
3210 But soft, what day is this?
3211 
3212 PARIS  Monday, my lord.
3213 
3214 CAPULET
3215 Monday, ha ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
3216 O' Thursday let it be.--O' Thursday, tell her,
3217 She shall be married to this noble earl.--
3218 Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
3219 We'll keep no great ado: a friend or two.
3220 For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3221 It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3222 Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
3223 Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
3224 And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
3225 
3226 PARIS
3227 My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
3228 
3229 CAPULET
3230 Well, get you gone. O' Thursday be it, then.
3231 [To Lady Capulet.] Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.
3232 Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.--
3233 Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!--
3234 Afore me, it is so very late that we
3235 May call it early by and by.--Good night.
3236 [They exit.]

3238 Scene 5
3239 =======
3240 [Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft.]
3241 
3242 
3243 JULIET
3244 Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
3245 It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3246 That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
3247 Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
3248 Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
3249 
3250 ROMEO
3251 It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
3252 No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
3253 Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
3254 Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
3255 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.
3256 I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
3257 
3258 JULIET
3259 Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
3260 It is some meteor that the sun exhaled
3261 To be to thee this night a torchbearer
3262 And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
3263 Therefore stay yet. Thou need'st not to be gone.
3264 
3265 ROMEO
3266 Let me be ta'en; let me be put to death.
3267 I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
3268 I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye;
3269 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow.
3270 Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
3271 The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
3272 I have more care to stay than will to go.
3273 Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
3274 How is 't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.
3275 
3276 JULIET
3277 It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!
3278 It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3279 Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3280 Some say the lark makes sweet division.
3281 This doth not so, for she divideth us.
3282 Some say the lark and loathed toad changed eyes.
3283 O, now I would they had changed voices too,
3284 Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3285 Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
3286 O, now begone. More light and light it grows.
3287 
3288 ROMEO
3289 More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
3290 
3291 [Enter Nurse.]
3292 
3293 
3294 NURSE  Madam.
3295 
3296 JULIET  Nurse?
3297 
3298 NURSE
3299 Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
3300 The day is broke; be wary; look about.	[She exits.]
3301 
3302 JULIET
3303 Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
3304 
3305 ROMEO
3306 Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I'll descend.
3307 [They kiss, and Romeo descends.]
3308 
3309 JULIET
3310 Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend!
3311 I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
3312 For in a minute there are many days.
3313 O, by this count I shall be much in years
3314 Ere I again behold my Romeo.
3315 
3316 ROMEO  Farewell.
3317 I will omit no opportunity
3318 That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
3319 
3320 JULIET
3321 O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
3322 
3323 ROMEO
3324 I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
3325 For sweet discourses in our times to come.
3326 
3327 JULIET
3328 O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
3329 Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
3330 As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
3331 Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale.
3332 
3333 ROMEO
3334 And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
3335 Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.	[He exits.]
3336 
3337 JULIET
3338 O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.
3339 If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
3340 That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
3341 For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,
3342 But send him back.
3343 
3344 [Enter Lady Capulet.]
3345 
3346 
3347 LADY CAPULET  Ho, daughter, are you up?
3348 
3349 JULIET
3350 Who is 't that calls? It is my lady mother.
3351 Is she not down so late or up so early?
3352 What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
3353 [Juliet descends.]
3354 
3355 LADY CAPULET
3356 Why, how now, Juliet?
3357 
3358 JULIET  Madam, I am not well.
3359 
3360 LADY CAPULET
3361 Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
3362 What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
3363 An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
3364 Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of
3365 love,
3366 But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
3367 
3368 JULIET
3369 Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
3370 
3371 LADY CAPULET
3372 So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
3373 Which you weep for.
3374 
3375 JULIET  Feeling so the loss,
3376 I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
3377 
3378 LADY CAPULET
3379 Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
3380 As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
3381 
3382 JULIET
3383 What villain, madam?
3384 
3385 LADY CAPULET  That same villain, Romeo.
3386 
3387 JULIET, [aside]
3388 Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
3389 God pardon him. I do with all my heart,
3390 And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
3391 
3392 LADY CAPULET
3393 That is because the traitor murderer lives.
3394 
3395 JULIET
3396 Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
3397 Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
3398 
3399 LADY CAPULET
3400 We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
3401 Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
3402 Where that same banished runagate doth live,
3403 Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram
3404 That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.
3405 And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
3406 
3407 JULIET
3408 Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
3409 With Romeo till I behold him--dead--
3410 Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.
3411 Madam, if you could find out but a man
3412 To bear a poison, I would temper it,
3413 That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
3414 Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
3415 To hear him named and cannot come to him
3416 To wreak the love I bore my cousin
3417 Upon his body that hath slaughtered him.
3418 
3419 LADY CAPULET
3420 Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
3421 But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
3422 
3423 JULIET
3424 And joy comes well in such a needy time.
3425 What are they, beseech your Ladyship?
3426 
3427 LADY CAPULET
3428 Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,
3429 One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
3430 Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
3431 That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.
3432 
3433 JULIET
3434 Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
3435 
3436 LADY CAPULET
3437 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
3438 The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
3439 The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church
3440 Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
3441 
3442 JULIET
3443 Now, by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
3444 He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
3445 I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
3446 Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
3447 I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
3448 I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear
3449 It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
3450 Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
3451 
3452 LADY CAPULET
3453 Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
3454 And see how he will take it at your hands.
3455 
3456 [Enter Capulet and Nurse.]
3457 
3458 
3459 CAPULET
3460 When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,
3461 But for the sunset of my brother's son
3462 It rains downright.
3463 How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
3464 Evermore show'ring? In one little body
3465 Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
3466 For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
3467 Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
3468 Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,
3469 Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
3470 Without a sudden calm, will overset
3471 Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife?
3472 Have you delivered to her our decree?
3473 
3474 LADY CAPULET
3475 Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.
3476 I would the fool were married to her grave.
3477 
3478 CAPULET
3479 Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.
3480 How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
3481 Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,
3482 Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
3483 So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?
3484 
3485 JULIET
3486 Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
3487 Proud can I never be of what I hate,
3488 But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
3489 
3490 CAPULET
3491 How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?
3492 "Proud," and "I thank you," and "I thank you not,"
3493 And yet "not proud"? Mistress minion you,
3494 Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
3495 But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
3496 To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
3497 Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
3498 Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
3499 You tallow face!
3500 
3501 LADY CAPULET  Fie, fie, what, are you mad?
3502 
3503 JULIET, [kneeling]
3504 Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
3505 Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
3506 
3507 CAPULET
3508 Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!
3509 I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
3510 Or never after look me in the face.
3511 Speak not; reply not; do not answer me.
3512 My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us
3513 blessed
3514 That God had lent us but this only child,
3515 But now I see this one is one too much,
3516 And that we have a curse in having her.
3517 Out on her, hilding.
3518 
3519 NURSE  God in heaven bless her!
3520 You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3521 
3522 CAPULET
3523 And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue.
3524 Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.
3525 
3526 NURSE
3527 I speak no treason.
3528 
3529 CAPULET  O, God 'i' g' eden!
3530 
3531 NURSE
3532 May not one speak?
3533 
3534 CAPULET  Peace, you mumbling fool!
3535 Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
3536 For here we need it not.
3537 
3538 LADY CAPULET  You are too hot.
3539 
3540 CAPULET  God's bread, it makes me mad.
3541 Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
3542 Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3543 To have her matched. And having now provided
3544 A gentleman of noble parentage,
3545 Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ligned,
3546 Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,
3547 Proportioned as one's thought would wish a man--
3548 And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3549 A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3550 To answer "I'll not wed. I cannot love.
3551 I am too young. I pray you, pardon me."
3552 But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you!
3553 Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
3554 Look to 't; think on 't. I do not use to jest.
3555 Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart; advise.
3556 An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.
3557 An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
3558 For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3559 Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
3560 Trust to 't; bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.
3561 [He exits.]
3562 
3563 JULIET
3564 Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
3565 That sees into the bottom of my grief?--
3566 O sweet my mother, cast me not away.
3567 Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
3568 Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3569 In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3570 
3571 LADY CAPULET
3572 Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
3573 Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3574 [She exits.]
3575 
3576 JULIET, [rising]
3577 O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
3578 My husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven.
3579 How shall that faith return again to Earth
3580 Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3581 By leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.--
3582 Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems
3583 Upon so soft a subject as myself.--
3584 What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
3585 Some comfort, nurse.
3586 
3587 NURSE  Faith, here it is.
3588 Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing
3589 That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you,
3590 Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3591 Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3592 I think it best you married with the County.
3593 O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3594 Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
3595 Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3596 As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3597 I think you are happy in this second match,
3598 For it excels your first, or, if it did not,
3599 Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were
3600 As living here and you no use of him.
3601 
3602 JULIET
3603 Speak'st thou from thy heart?
3604 
3605 NURSE
3606 And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.
3607 
3608 JULIET  Amen.
3609 
3610 NURSE  What?
3611 
3612 JULIET
3613 Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.
3614 Go in and tell my lady I am gone,
3615 Having displeased my father, to Lawrence' cell
3616 To make confession and to be absolved.
3617 
3618 NURSE
3619 Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.	[She exits.]
3620 
3621 JULIET
3622 Ancient damnation, O most wicked fiend!
3623 Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
3624 Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3625 Which she hath praised him with above compare
3626 So many thousand times? Go, counselor.
3627 Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3628 I'll to the Friar to know his remedy.
3629 If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3630 [She exits.]

3633 ACT 4
3634 =====
3635 
3636 Scene 1
3637 =======
3638 [Enter Friar Lawrence and County Paris.]
3639 
3640 
3641 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3642 On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
3643 
3644 PARIS
3645 My father Capulet will have it so,
3646 And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3647 
3648 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3649 You say you do not know the lady's mind?
3650 Uneven is the course. I like it not.
3651 
3652 PARIS
3653 Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3654 And therefore have I little talk of love,
3655 For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3656 Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3657 That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
3658 And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
3659 To stop the inundation of her tears,
3660 Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3661 May be put from her by society.
3662 Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3663 
3664 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [aside]
3665 I would I knew not why it should be slowed.--
3666 Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
3667 
3668 [Enter Juliet.]
3669 
3670 
3671 PARIS
3672 Happily met, my lady and my wife.
3673 
3674 JULIET
3675 That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3676 
3677 PARIS
3678 That "may be" must be, love, on Thursday next.
3679 
3680 JULIET
3681 What must be shall be.
3682 
3683 FRIAR LAWRENCE  That's a certain text.
3684 
3685 PARIS
3686 Come you to make confession to this father?
3687 
3688 JULIET
3689 To answer that, I should confess to you.
3690 
3691 PARIS
3692 Do not deny to him that you love me.
3693 
3694 JULIET
3695 I will confess to you that I love him.
3696 
3697 PARIS
3698 So will you, I am sure, that you love me.
3699 
3700 JULIET
3701 If I do so, it will be of more price
3702 Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
3703 
3704 PARIS
3705 Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3706 
3707 JULIET
3708 The tears have got small victory by that,
3709 For it was bad enough before their spite.
3710 
3711 PARIS
3712 Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
3713 
3714 JULIET
3715 That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
3716 And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3717 
3718 PARIS
3719 Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.
3720 
3721 JULIET
3722 It may be so, for it is not mine own.--
3723 Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
3724 Or shall I come to you at evening Mass?
3725 
3726 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3727 My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.--
3728 My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3729 
3730 PARIS
3731 God shield I should disturb devotion!--
3732 Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.
3733 Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.	[He exits.]
3734 
3735 JULIET
3736 O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
3737 Come weep with me, past hope, past care, past help.
3738 
3739 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3740 O Juliet, I already know thy grief.
3741 It strains me past the compass of my wits.
3742 I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3743 On Thursday next be married to this County.
3744 
3745 JULIET
3746 Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,
3747 Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
3748 If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
3749 Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3750 And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3751 [She shows him her knife.]
3752 God joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3753 And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's sealed,
3754 Shall be the label to another deed,
3755 Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3756 Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
3757 Therefore out of thy long-experienced time
3758 Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3759 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3760 Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3761 Which the commission of thy years and art
3762 Could to no issue of true honor bring.
3763 Be not so long to speak. I long to die
3764 If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3765 
3766 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3767 Hold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,
3768 Which craves as desperate an execution
3769 As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3770 If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3771 Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3772 Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3773 A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3774 That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;
3775 And if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3776 
3777 JULIET
3778 O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3779 From off the battlements of any tower,
3780 Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
3781 Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears,
3782 Or hide me nightly in a charnel house,
3783 O'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3784 With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
3785 Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3786 And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
3787 (Things that to hear them told have made me
3788 tremble),
3789 And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3790 To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.
3791 
3792 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3793 Hold, then. Go home; be merry; give consent
3794 To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow.
3795 Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone;
3796 Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
3797 [Holding out a vial.]
3798 Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3799 And this distilling liquor drink thou off;
3800 When presently through all thy veins shall run
3801 A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse
3802 Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
3803 No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.
3804 The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3805 To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
3806 Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
3807 Each part, deprived of supple government,
3808 Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,
3809 And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
3810 Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
3811 And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3812 Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3813 To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
3814 Then, as the manner of our country is,
3815 In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
3816 Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3817 Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3818 In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
3819 Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3820 And hither shall he come, and he and I
3821 Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3822 Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3823 And this shall free thee from this present shame,
3824 If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
3825 Abate thy valor in the acting it.
3826 
3827 JULIET
3828 Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3829 
3830 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [giving Juliet the vial]
3831 Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous
3832 In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
3833 To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.
3834 
3835 JULIET
3836 Love give me strength, and strength shall help
3837 afford.
3838 Farewell, dear father.

3843 [Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
3844 two or three.]
3845 
3846 
3847 CAPULET
3848 So many guests invite as here are writ.
3849 [One or two of the Servingmen exit
3850 with Capulet's list.]
3851 Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3852 
3853 SERVINGMAN  You shall have none ill, sir, for I'll try if
3854 they can lick their fingers.
3855 
3856 CAPULET  How canst thou try them so?
3857 
3858 SERVINGMAN  Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick
3859 his own fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his
3860 fingers goes not with me.
3861 
3862 CAPULET  Go, begone.	[Servingman exits.]
3863 We shall be much unfurnished for this time.--
3864 What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
3865 
3866 NURSE  Ay, forsooth.
3867 
3868 CAPULET
3869 Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
3870 A peevish self-willed harlotry it is.
3871 
3872 [Enter Juliet.]
3873 
3874 
3875 NURSE
3876 See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3877 
3878 CAPULET
3879 How now, my headstrong, where have you been
3880 gadding?
3881 
3882 JULIET
3883 Where I have learned me to repent the sin
3884 Of disobedient opposition
3885 To you and your behests, and am enjoined
3886 By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here	[Kneeling.]
3887 To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.
3888 Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3889 
3890 CAPULET
3891 Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
3892 I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
3893 
3894 JULIET
3895 I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell
3896 And gave him what becomed love I might,
3897 Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
3898 
3899 CAPULET
3900 Why, I am glad on 't. This is well. Stand up.
3901 [Juliet rises.]
3902 This is as 't should be.--Let me see the County.
3903 Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--
3904 Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
3905 All our whole city is much bound to him.
3906 
3907 JULIET
3908 Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
3909 To help me sort such needful ornaments
3910 As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
3911 
3912 LADY CAPULET
3913 No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
3914 
3915 CAPULET
3916 Go, nurse. Go with her. We'll to church tomorrow.
3917 [Juliet and the Nurse exit.]
3918 
3919 LADY CAPULET
3920 We shall be short in our provision.
3921 'Tis now near night.
3922 
3923 CAPULET  Tush, I will stir about,
3924 And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
3925 Go thou to Juliet. Help to deck up her.
3926 I'll not to bed tonight. Let me alone.
3927 I'll play the housewife for this once.--What ho!--
3928 They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3929 To County Paris, to prepare up him
3930 Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light
3931 Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.

3936 [Enter Juliet and Nurse.]
3937 
3938 
3939 JULIET
3940 Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle nurse,
3941 I pray thee leave me to myself tonight,
3942 For I have need of many orisons
3943 To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3944 Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
3945 
3946 [Enter Lady Capulet.]
3947 
3948 
3949 LADY CAPULET
3950 What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
3951 
3952 JULIET
3953 No, madam, we have culled such necessaries
3954 As are behooveful for our state tomorrow.
3955 So please you, let me now be left alone,
3956 And let the Nurse this night sit up with you,
3957 For I am sure you have your hands full all
3958 In this so sudden business.
3959 
3960 LADY CAPULET  Good night.
3961 Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
3962 [Lady Capulet and the Nurse exit.]
3963 
3964 JULIET
3965 Farewell.--God knows when we shall meet again.
3966 I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
3967 That almost freezes up the heat of life.
3968 I'll call them back again to comfort me.--
3969 Nurse!--What should she do here?
3970 My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3971 Come, vial.	[She takes out the vial.]
3972 What if this mixture do not work at all?
3973 Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
3974 [She takes out her knife
3975 and puts it down beside her.]
3976 No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
3977 What if it be a poison which the Friar
3978 Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,
3979 Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored
3980 Because he married me before to Romeo?
3981 I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
3982 For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3983 How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3984 I wake before the time that Romeo
3985 Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point.
3986 Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
3987 To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3988 And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3989 Or, if I live, is it not very like
3990 The horrible conceit of death and night,
3991 Together with the terror of the place--
3992 As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
3993 Where for this many hundred years the bones
3994 Of all my buried ancestors are packed;
3995 Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3996 Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
3997 At some hours in the night spirits resort--
3998 Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3999 So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
4000 And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
4001 That living mortals, hearing them, run mad--
4002 O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
4003 Environed with all these hideous fears,
4004 And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
4005 And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,
4006 And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
4007 As with a club, dash out my desp'rate brains?
4008 O look, methinks I see my cousin's ghost
4009 Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
4010 Upon a rapier's point! Stay, Tybalt, stay!
4011 Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's drink. I drink to
4012 thee.	[She drinks and falls upon her bed
4013 within the curtains.]

4016 =======
4017 [Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]
4018 
4019 
4020 LADY CAPULET
4021 Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
4022 
4023 NURSE
4024 They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
4025 
4026 [Enter old Capulet.]
4027 
4028 
4029 CAPULET
4030 Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crowed.
4031 The curfew bell hath rung. 'Tis three o'clock.--
4032 Look to the baked meats, good Angelica.
4033 Spare not for cost.
4034 
4035 NURSE  Go, you cot-quean, go,
4036 Get you to bed. Faith, you'll be sick tomorrow
4037 For this night's watching.
4038 
4039 CAPULET
4040 No, not a whit. What, I have watched ere now
4041 All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
4042 
4043 LADY CAPULET
4044 Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,
4045 But I will watch you from such watching now.
4046 [Lady Capulet and Nurse exit.]
4047 
4048 CAPULET
4049 A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
4050 
4051 [Enter three or four Servingmen with spits and logs
4052 and baskets.]
4053 
4054 Now fellow,
4055 What is there?
4056 
4057 FIRST SERVINGMAN
4058 Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.
4059 
4060 CAPULET
4061 Make haste, make haste.	[First Servingman exits.]
4062 Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
4063 Call Peter. He will show thee where they are.
4064 
4065 SECOND SERVINGMAN
4066 I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
4067 And never trouble Peter for the matter.
4068 
4069 CAPULET
4070 Mass, and well said. A merry whoreson, ha!
4071 Thou shalt be loggerhead.
4072 [Second Servingman exits.]
4073 Good faith, 'tis day.
4074 The County will be here with music straight,
4075 [Play music.]
4076 For so he said he would. I hear him near.--
4077 Nurse!--Wife! What ho!--What, nurse, I say!
4078 
4079 [Enter Nurse.]
4080 
4081 Go waken Juliet. Go and trim her up.
4082 I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
4083 Make haste. The bridegroom he is come already.
4084 Make haste, I say.
4085 [He exits.]

4087 Scene 5
4088 =======
4089 
4090 NURSE, [approaching the bed]
4091 Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet!--Fast, I warrant
4092 her, she--
4093 Why, lamb, why, lady! Fie, you slugabed!
4094 Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!--
4095 What, not a word?--You take your pennyworths
4096 now.
4097 Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,
4098 The County Paris hath set up his rest
4099 That you shall rest but little.--God forgive me,
4100 Marry, and amen! How sound is she asleep!
4101 I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!
4102 Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
4103 He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?
4104 [She opens the bed's curtains.]
4105 What, dressed, and in your clothes, and down
4106 again?
4107 I must needs wake you. Lady, lady, lady!--
4108 Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead.--
4109 O, weraday, that ever I was born!--
4110 Some aqua vitae, ho!--My lord! My lady!
4111 
4112 [Enter Lady Capulet.]
4113 
4114 
4115 LADY CAPULET
4116 What noise is here?
4117 
4118 NURSE  O lamentable day!
4119 
4120 LADY CAPULET
4121 What is the matter?
4122 
4123 NURSE  Look, look!--O heavy day!
4124 
4125 LADY CAPULET
4126 O me! O me! My child, my only life,
4127 Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.
4128 Help, help! Call help.
4129 
4130 [Enter Capulet.]
4131 
4132 
4133 CAPULET
4134 For shame, bring Juliet forth. Her lord is come.
4135 
4136 NURSE
4137 She's dead, deceased. She's dead, alack the day!
4138 
4139 LADY CAPULET
4140 Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead.
4141 
4142 CAPULET
4143 Ha, let me see her! Out, alas, she's cold.
4144 Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.
4145 Life and these lips have long been separated.
4146 Death lies on her like an untimely frost
4147 Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
4148 
4149 NURSE
4150 O lamentable day!
4151 
4152 LADY CAPULET  O woeful time!
4153 
4154 CAPULET
4155 Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
4156 Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
4157 
4158 [Enter Friar Lawrence and the County Paris, with
4159 Musicians.]
4160 
4161 
4162 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4163 Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
4164 
4165 CAPULET
4166 Ready to go, but never to return.--
4167 O son, the night before thy wedding day
4168 Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
4169 Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
4170 Death is my son-in-law; Death is my heir.
4171 My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
4172 And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
4173 
4174 PARIS
4175 Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
4176 And doth it give me such a sight as this?
4177 
4178 LADY CAPULET
4179 Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
4180 Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
4181 In lasting labor of his pilgrimage!
4182 But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
4183 But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
4184 And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!
4185 
4186 NURSE
4187 O woe, O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
4188 Most lamentable day, most woeful day
4189 That ever, ever I did yet behold!
4190 O day, O day, O day, O hateful day!
4191 Never was seen so black a day as this!
4192 O woeful day, O woeful day!
4193 
4194 PARIS
4195 Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
4196 Most detestable death, by thee beguiled,
4197 By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!
4198 O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!
4199 
4200 CAPULET
4201 Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
4202 Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
4203 To murder, murder our solemnity?
4204 O child! O child! My soul and not my child!
4205 Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,
4206 And with my child my joys are buried.
4207 
4208 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4209 Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
4210 In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
4211 Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all,
4212 And all the better is it for the maid.
4213 Your part in her you could not keep from death,
4214 But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
4215 The most you sought was her promotion,
4216 For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced;
4217 And weep you now, seeing she is advanced
4218 Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
4219 O, in this love you love your child so ill
4220 That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
4221 She's not well married that lives married long,
4222 But she's best married that dies married young.
4223 Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
4224 On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
4225 And in her best array, bear her to church,
4226 For though fond nature bids us all lament,
4227 Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
4228 
4229 CAPULET
4230 All things that we ordained festival
4231 Turn from their office to black funeral:
4232 Our instruments to melancholy bells,
4233 Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
4234 Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
4235 Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
4236 And all things change them to the contrary.
4237 
4238 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4239 Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
4240 And go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare
4241 To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
4242 The heavens do lour upon you for some ill.
4243 Move them no more by crossing their high will.
4244 [All but the Nurse and the Musicians exit.]
4245 
4246 FIRST MUSICIAN
4247 Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
4248 
4249 NURSE
4250 Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
4251 For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
4252 
4253 FIRST MUSICIAN
4254 Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
4255 [Nurse exits.]
4256 
4257 [Enter Peter.]
4258 
4259 
4260 PETER  Musicians, O musicians, "Heart's ease,"
4261 "Heart's ease." O, an you will have me live, play
4262 "Heart's ease."
4263 
4264 FIRST MUSICIAN  Why "Heart's ease?"
4265 
4266 PETER  O musicians, because my heart itself plays "My
4267 heart is full." O, play me some merry dump to
4268 comfort me.
4269 
4270 FIRST MUSICIAN  Not a dump, we. 'Tis no time to play
4271 now.
4272 
4273 PETER  You will not then?
4274 
4275 FIRST MUSICIAN  No.
4276 
4277 PETER  I will then give it you soundly.
4278 
4279 FIRST MUSICIAN  What will you give us?
4280 
4281 PETER  No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give
4282 you the minstrel.
4283 
4284 FIRST MUSICIAN  Then will I give you the
4285 serving-creature.
4286 
4287 PETER  Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
4288 your pate. I will carry no crochets. I'll re you, I'll fa
4289 you. Do you note me?
4290 
4291 FIRST MUSICIAN  An you re us and fa us, you note us.
4292 
4293 SECOND MUSICIAN  Pray you, put up your dagger and
4294 put out your wit.
4295 
4296 PETER  Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat
4297 you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.
4298 Answer me like men.
4299 [Sings.]	When griping griefs the heart doth wound
4300 	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
4301 	Then music with her silver sound--
4302 Why "silver sound"? Why "music with her silver
4303 sound"? What say you, Simon Catling?
4304 
4305 FIRST MUSICIAN  Marry, sir, because silver hath a
4306 sweet sound.
4307 
4308 PETER  Prates.--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
4309 
4310 SECOND MUSICIAN  I say "silver sound" because musicians
4311 sound for silver.
4312 
4313 PETER  Prates too.--What say you, James Soundpost?
4314 
4315 THIRD MUSICIAN  Faith, I know not what to say.
4316 
4317 PETER  O, I cry you mercy. You are the singer. I will say
4318 for you. It is "music with her silver sound" because
4319 musicians have no gold for sounding:
4320 [Sings.]	Then music with her silver sound
4321 	With speedy help doth lend redress.
4322 [He exits.]
4323 
4324 FIRST MUSICIAN  What a pestilent knave is this same!
4325 
4326 SECOND MUSICIAN  Hang him, Jack. Come, we'll in
4327 here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.
4328 [They exit.]

4334 Scene 1
4335 =======
4336 [Enter Romeo.]
4337 
4338 
4339 ROMEO
4340 If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
4341 My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
4342 My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
4343 And all this day an unaccustomed spirit
4344 Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
4345 I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
4346 (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to
4347 think!)
4348 And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
4349 That I revived and was an emperor.
4350 Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed
4351 When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
4352 
4353 [Enter Romeo's man Balthasar, in riding boots.]
4354 
4355 News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar?
4356 Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
4357 How doth my lady? Is my father well?
4358 How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,
4359 For nothing can be ill if she be well.
4360 
4361 BALTHASAR
4362 Then she is well and nothing can be ill.
4363 Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,
4364 And her immortal part with angels lives.
4365 I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
4366 And presently took post to tell it you.
4367 O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
4368 Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
4369 
4370 ROMEO
4371 Is it e'en so?--Then I deny you, stars!--
4372 Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
4373 And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
4374 
4375 BALTHASAR
4376 I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
4377 Your looks are pale and wild and do import
4378 Some misadventure.
4379 
4380 ROMEO  Tush, thou art deceived.
4381 Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
4382 Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
4383 
4384 BALTHASAR
4385 No, my good lord.
4386 
4387 ROMEO  No matter. Get thee gone,
4388 And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
4389 [Balthasar exits.]
4390 Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
4391 Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
4392 To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
4393 I do remember an apothecary
4394 (And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted
4395 In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,
4396 Culling of simples. Meager were his looks.
4397 Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.
4398 And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
4399 An alligator stuffed, and other skins
4400 Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,
4401 A beggarly account of empty boxes,
4402 Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
4403 Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
4404 Were thinly scattered to make up a show.
4405 Noting this penury, to myself I said
4406 "An if a man did need a poison now,
4407 Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
4408 Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him."
4409 O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
4410 And this same needy man must sell it me.
4411 As I remember, this should be the house.
4412 Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--
4413 What ho, Apothecary!
4414 
4415 [Enter Apothecary.]
4416 
4417 
4418 APOTHECARY  Who calls so loud?
4419 
4420 ROMEO
4421 Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
4422 [He offers money.]
4423 Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
4424 A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
4425 As will disperse itself through all the veins,
4426 That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
4427 And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
4428 As violently as hasty powder fired
4429 Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
4430 
4431 APOTHECARY
4432 Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law
4433 Is death to any he that utters them.
4434 
4435 ROMEO
4436 Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
4437 And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
4438 Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,
4439 Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
4440 The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law.
4441 The world affords no law to make thee rich.
4442 Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
4443 
4444 APOTHECARY
4445 My poverty, but not my will, consents.
4446 
4447 ROMEO
4448 I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
4449 
4450 APOTHECARY, [giving him the poison]
4451 Put this in any liquid thing you will
4452 And drink it off, and if you had the strength
4453 Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
4454 
4455 ROMEO, [handing him the money]
4456 There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
4457 Doing more murder in this loathsome world
4458 Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not
4459 sell.
4460 I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
4461 Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
4462 [Apothecary exits.]
4463 Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
4464 To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.
4465 [He exits.]

4471 
4472 FRIAR JOHN
4473 Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
4474 
4475 [Enter Friar Lawrence.]
4476 
4477 
4478 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4479 This same should be the voice of Friar John.--
4480 Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
4481 Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
4482 
4483 FRIAR JOHN
4484 Going to find a barefoot brother out,
4485 One of our order, to associate me,
4486 Here in this city visiting the sick,
4487 And finding him, the searchers of the town,
4488 Suspecting that we both were in a house
4489 Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
4490 Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth,
4491 So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.
4492 
4493 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4494 Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
4495 
4496 FRIAR JOHN
4497 I could not send it--here it is again--
4498 [Returning the letter.]
4499 Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
4500 So fearful were they of infection.
4501 
4502 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4503 Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
4504 The letter was not nice but full of charge,
4505 Of dear import, and the neglecting it
4506 May do much danger. Friar John, go hence.
4507 Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
4508 Unto my cell.
4509 
4510 FRIAR JOHN
4511 Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.	[He exits.]
4512 
4513 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4514 Now must I to the monument alone.
4515 Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
4516 She will beshrew me much that Romeo
4517 Hath had no notice of these accidents.
4518 But I will write again to Mantua,
4519 And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
4520 Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
4521 [He exits.]

4523 Scene 3
4524 =======
4525 [Enter Paris and his Page.]
4526 
4527 
4528 PARIS
4529 Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
4530 Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
4531 Under yond yew trees lay thee all along,
4532 Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground.
4533 So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
4534 (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
4535 But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me
4536 As signal that thou hearest something approach.
4537 Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.
4538 
4539 PAGE, [aside]
4540 I am almost afraid to stand alone
4541 Here in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.
4542 [He moves away from Paris.]
4543 
4544 PARIS, [scattering flowers]
4545 Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
4546 (O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)
4547 Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
4548 Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.
4549 The obsequies that I for thee will keep
4550 Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
4551 [Page whistles.]
4552 The boy gives warning something doth approach.
4553 What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
4554 To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
4555 What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.
4556 [He steps aside.]
4557 
4558 [Enter Romeo and Balthasar.]
4559 
4560 
4561 ROMEO
4562 Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
4563 Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
4564 See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
4565 Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
4566 Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
4567 And do not interrupt me in my course.
4568 Why I descend into this bed of death
4569 Is partly to behold my lady's face,
4570 But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
4571 A precious ring, a ring that I must use
4572 In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.
4573 But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
4574 In what I farther shall intend to do,
4575 By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
4576 And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
4577 The time and my intents are savage-wild,
4578 More fierce and more inexorable far
4579 Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
4580 
4581 BALTHASAR
4582 I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
4583 
4584 ROMEO
4585 So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
4586 [Giving money.]
4587 Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.
4588 
4589 BALTHASAR, [aside]
4590 For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
4591 His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
4592 [He steps aside.]
4593 
4594 ROMEO, [beginning to force open the tomb]
4595 Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
4596 Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
4597 Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
4598 And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
4599 
4600 PARIS
4601 This is that banished haughty Montague
4602 That murdered my love's cousin, with which grief
4603 It is supposed the fair creature died,
4604 And here is come to do some villainous shame
4605 To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
4606 [Stepping forward.]
4607 Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague.
4608 Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
4609 Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
4610 Obey and go with me, for thou must die.
4611 
4612 ROMEO
4613 I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
4614 Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
4615 Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.
4616 Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
4617 Put not another sin upon my head
4618 By urging me to fury. O, begone!
4619 By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
4620 For I come hither armed against myself.
4621 Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say
4622 A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
4623 
4624 PARIS
4625 I do defy thy commination
4626 And apprehend thee for a felon here.
4627 
4628 ROMEO
4629 Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
4630 [They draw and fight.]
4631 
4632 PAGE
4633 O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
4634 [He exits.]
4635 
4636 PARIS
4637 O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
4638 Open the tomb; lay me with Juliet.	[He dies.]
4639 
4640 ROMEO
4641 In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face.
4642 Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
4643 What said my man when my betossed soul
4644 Did not attend him as we rode? I think
4645 He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
4646 Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
4647 Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
4648 To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,
4649 One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
4650 I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.--
4651 [He opens the tomb.]
4652 A grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,
4653 For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
4654 This vault a feasting presence full of light.--
4655 Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.
4656 [Laying Paris in the tomb.]
4657 How oft when men are at the point of death
4658 Have they been merry, which their keepers call
4659 A light'ning before death! O, how may I
4660 Call this a light'ning?--O my love, my wife,
4661 Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
4662 Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
4663 Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet
4664 Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
4665 And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--
4666 Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
4667 O, what more favor can I do to thee
4668 Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
4669 To sunder his that was thine enemy?
4670 Forgive me, cousin.--Ah, dear Juliet,
4671 Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
4672 That unsubstantial death is amorous,
4673 And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4674 Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4675 For fear of that I still will stay with thee
4676 And never from this palace of dim night
4677 Depart again. Here, here will I remain
4678 With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
4679 Will I set up my everlasting rest
4680 And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4681 From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.
4682 Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you
4683 The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4684 A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
4685 [Kissing Juliet.]
4686 Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!
4687 Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4688 The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
4689 Here's to my love. [Drinking.] O true apothecary,
4690 Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
4691 [He dies.]
4692 
4693 [Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.]
4694 
4695 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4696 Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight
4697 Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?
4698 
4699 BALTHASAR
4700 Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4701 
4702 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4703 Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
4704 What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
4705 To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
4706 It burneth in the Capels' monument.
4707 
4708 BALTHASAR
4709 It doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,
4710 One that you love.
4711 
4712 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?
4713 
4714 BALTHASAR  Romeo.
4715 
4716 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4717 How long hath he been there?
4718 
4719 BALTHASAR  Full half an hour.
4720 
4721 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4722 Go with me to the vault.
4723 
4724 BALTHASAR  I dare not, sir.
4725 My master knows not but I am gone hence,
4726 And fearfully did menace me with death
4727 If I did stay to look on his intents.
4728 
4729 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4730 Stay, then. I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
4731 O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
4732 
4733 BALTHASAR
4734 As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
4735 I dreamt my master and another fought,
4736 And that my master slew him.
4737 
4738 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [moving toward the tomb]
4739 Romeo!--
4740 Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
4741 The stony entrance of this sepulcher?
4742 What mean these masterless and gory swords
4743 To lie discolored by this place of peace?
4744 Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
4745 And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
4746 Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
4747 The lady stirs.
4748 
4749 JULIET
4750 O comfortable friar, where is my lord?
4751 I do remember well where I should be,
4752 And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
4753 
4754 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4755 I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest
4756 Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
4757 A greater power than we can contradict
4758 Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
4759 Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,
4760 And Paris, too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
4761 Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
4762 Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
4763 Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
4764 
4765 JULIET
4766 Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
4767 [He exits.]
4768 What's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?
4769 Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.--
4770 O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop
4771 To help me after! I will kiss thy lips.
4772 Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
4773 To make me die with a restorative.	[She kisses him.]
4774 Thy lips are warm!
4775 
4776 [Enter Paris's Page and Watch.]
4777 
4778 
4779 FIRST WATCH  Lead, boy. Which way?
4780 
4781 JULIET
4782 Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O, happy dagger,
4783 This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.
4784 [She takes Romeo's dagger, stabs herself, and dies.]
4785 
4786 PAGE
4787 This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.
4788 
4789 FIRST WATCH
4790 The ground is bloody.--Search about the
4791 churchyard.
4792 Go, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach.
4793 [Some watchmen exit.]
4794 Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
4795 And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
4796 Who here hath lain this two days buried.--
4797 Go, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets.
4798 Raise up the Montagues. Some others search.
4799 [Others exit.]
4800 We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
4801 But the true ground of all these piteous woes
4802 We cannot without circumstance descry.
4803 
4804 [Enter Watchmen with Romeo's man Balthasar.]
4805 
4806 
4807 SECOND WATCH
4808 Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the
4809 churchyard.
4810 
4811 FIRST WATCH
4812 Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
4813 
4814 [Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.]
4815 
4816 
4817 THIRD WATCH
4818 Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
4819 We took this mattock and this spade from him
4820 As he was coming from this churchyard's side.
4821 
4822 FIRST WATCH
4823 A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.
4824 
4825 [Enter the Prince with Attendants.]
4826 
4827 
4828 PRINCE
4829 What misadventure is so early up
4830 That calls our person from our morning rest?
4831 
4832 [Enter Capulet and Lady Capulet.]
4833 
4834 
4835 CAPULET
4836 What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?
4837 
4838 LADY CAPULET
4839 O, the people in the street cry "Romeo,"
4840 Some "Juliet," and some "Paris," and all run
4841 With open outcry toward our monument.
4842 
4843 PRINCE
4844 What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4845 
4846 FIRST WATCH
4847 Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
4848 And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
4849 Warm and new killed.
4850 
4851 PRINCE
4852 Search, seek, and know how this foul murder
4853 comes.
4854 
4855 FIRST WATCH
4856 Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man,
4857 With instruments upon them fit to open
4858 These dead men's tombs.
4859 
4860 CAPULET
4861 O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4862 This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
4863 Is empty on the back of Montague,
4864 And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.
4865 
4866 LADY CAPULET
4867 O me, this sight of death is as a bell
4868 That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
4869 
4870 [Enter Montague.]
4871 
4872 
4873 PRINCE
4874 Come, Montague, for thou art early up
4875 To see thy son and heir now early down.
4876 
4877 MONTAGUE
4878 Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
4879 Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.
4880 What further woe conspires against mine age?
4881 
4882 PRINCE  Look, and thou shalt see.
4883 
4884 MONTAGUE, [seeing Romeo dead]
4885 O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
4886 To press before thy father to a grave?
4887 
4888 PRINCE
4889 Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,
4890 Till we can clear these ambiguities
4891 And know their spring, their head, their true
4892 descent,
4893 And then will I be general of your woes
4894 And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
4895 And let mischance be slave to patience.--
4896 Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4897 
4898 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4899 I am the greatest, able to do least,
4900 Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4901 Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
4902 And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4903 Myself condemned and myself excused.
4904 
4905 PRINCE
4906 Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4907 
4908 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4909 I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4910 Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4911 Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
4912 And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
4913 I married them, and their stol'n marriage day
4914 Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
4915 Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,
4916 For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4917 You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4918 Betrothed and would have married her perforce
4919 To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
4920 And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
4921 To rid her from this second marriage,
4922 Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4923 Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
4924 A sleeping potion, which so took effect
4925 As I intended, for it wrought on her
4926 The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
4927 That he should hither come as this dire night
4928 To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
4929 Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4930 But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4931 Was stayed by accident, and yesternight
4932 Returned my letter back. Then all alone
4933 At the prefixed hour of her waking
4934 Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
4935 Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
4936 Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
4937 But when I came, some minute ere the time
4938 Of her awakening, here untimely lay
4939 The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4940 She wakes, and I entreated her come forth
4941 And bear this work of heaven with patience.
4942 But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
4943 And she, too desperate, would not go with me
4944 But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4945 All this I know, and to the marriage
4946 Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this
4947 Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4948 Be sacrificed some hour before his time
4949 Unto the rigor of severest law.
4950 
4951 PRINCE
4952 We still have known thee for a holy man.--
4953 Where's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?
4954 
4955 BALTHASAR
4956 I brought my master news of Juliet's death,
4957 And then in post he came from Mantua
4958 To this same place, to this same monument.
4959 This letter he early bid me give his father
4960 And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4961 If I departed not and left him there.
4962 
4963 PRINCE
4964 Give me the letter. I will look on it.--
4965 [He takes Romeo's letter.]
4966 Where is the County's page, that raised the
4967 watch?--
4968 Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4969 
4970 PAGE
4971 He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
4972 And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
4973 Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
4974 And by and by my master drew on him,
4975 And then I ran away to call the watch.
4976 
4977 PRINCE
4978 This letter doth make good the Friar's words,
4979 Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
4980 And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4981 Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4982 Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.
4983 Where be these enemies?--Capulet, Montague,
4984 See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4985 That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,
4986 And I, for winking at your discords too,
4987 Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.
4988 
4989 CAPULET
4990 O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
4991 This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4992 Can I demand.
4993 
4994 MONTAGUE  But I can give thee more,
4995 For I will ray her statue in pure gold,
4996 That whiles Verona by that name is known,
4997 There shall no figure at such rate be set
4998 As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4999 
5000 CAPULET
5001 As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,
5002 Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
5003 
5004 PRINCE
5005 A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
5006 The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
5007 Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.
5008 Some shall be pardoned, and some punished.
5009 For never was a story of more woe
5010 Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

43   THE PROLOGUE
44   ============
45   [Enter Chorus.]
46   
47   
48   Two households, both alike in dignity
49   (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),
50   From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
51   Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
52   From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
53   A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
54   Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
55   Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
56   The fearful passage of their death-marked love
57   And the continuance of their parents' rage,
58   Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
59   Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
60   The which, if you with patient ears attend,
61   What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

68   Scene 1
69   =======
70   [Enter Sampson and Gregory, with swords and bucklers,
71   of the house of Capulet.]
72   
73   
74   SAMPSON  Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals.
75   
76   GREGORY  No, for then we should be colliers.
77   
78   SAMPSON  I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
79   
80   GREGORY  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of
81   collar.
82   
83   SAMPSON  I strike quickly, being moved.
84   
85   GREGORY  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
86   
87   SAMPSON  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
88   
89   GREGORY  To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to
90   stand. Therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st
91   away.
92   
93   SAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I
94   will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
95   
96   GREGORY  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest
97   goes to the wall.
98   
99   SAMPSON  'Tis true, and therefore women, being the
100  weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore
101  I will push Montague's men from the wall and
102  thrust his maids to the wall.
103  
104  GREGORY  The quarrel is between our masters and us
105  their men.
106  
107  SAMPSON  'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.
108  When I have fought with the men, I will be civil
109  with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
110  
111  GREGORY  The heads of the maids?
112  
113  SAMPSON  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
114  Take it in what sense thou wilt.
115  
116  GREGORY  They must take it in sense that feel it.
117  
118  SAMPSON  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,
119  and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
120  
121  GREGORY  'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
122  hadst been poor-john. Draw thy tool. Here comes
123  of the house of Montagues.
124  
125  [Enter Abram with another Servingman.]
126  
127  
128  SAMPSON  My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back
129  thee.
130  
131  GREGORY  How? Turn thy back and run?
132  
133  SAMPSON  Fear me not.
134  
135  GREGORY  No, marry. I fear thee!
136  
137  SAMPSON  Let us take the law of our sides; let them
138  begin.
139  
140  GREGORY  I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it
141  as they list.
142  
143  SAMPSON  Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at
144  them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.
145  [He bites his thumb.]
146  
147  ABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
148  
149  SAMPSON  I do bite my thumb, sir.
150  
151  ABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
152  
153  SAMPSON, [aside to Gregory]  Is the law of our side if I
154  say "Ay"?
155  
156  GREGORY, [aside to Sampson]  No.
157  
158  SAMPSON  No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
159  but I bite my thumb, sir.
160  
161  GREGORY  Do you quarrel, sir?
162  
163  ABRAM  Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
164  
165  SAMPSON  But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as
166  good a man as you.
167  
168  ABRAM  No better.
169  
170  SAMPSON  Well, sir.
171  
172  [Enter Benvolio.]
173  
174  
175  GREGORY, [aside to Sampson]  Say "better"; here comes
176  one of my master's kinsmen.
177  
178  SAMPSON  Yes, better, sir.
179  
180  ABRAM  You lie.
181  
182  SAMPSON  Draw if you be men.--Gregory, remember
183  thy washing blow.	[They fight.]
184  
185  BENVOLIO  Part, fools!	[Drawing his sword.]
186  Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
187  
188  [Enter Tybalt, drawing his sword.]
189  
190  
191  TYBALT
192  What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
193  Turn thee, Benvolio; look upon thy death.
194  
195  BENVOLIO
196  I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
197  Or manage it to part these men with me.
198  
199  TYBALT
200  What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word
201  As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
202  Have at thee, coward!	[They fight.]
203  
204  [Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.]
205  
206  
207  CITIZENS
208  Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
209  Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
210  
211  [Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.]
212  
213  
214  CAPULET
215  What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
216  
217  LADY CAPULET
218  A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a
219  sword?
220  
221  [Enter old Montague and his Wife.]
222  
223  CAPULET
224  My sword, I say. Old Montague is come
225  And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
226  
227  MONTAGUE
228  Thou villain Capulet!--Hold me not; let me go.
229  
230  LADY MONTAGUE
231  Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
232  
233  [Enter Prince Escalus with his train.]
234  
235  
236  PRINCE
237  Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
238  Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel--
239  Will they not hear?--What ho! You men, you beasts,
240  That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
241  With purple fountains issuing from your veins:
242  On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
243  Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,
244  And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
245  Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
246  By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
247  Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets
248  And made Verona's ancient citizens
249  Cast by their grave-beseeming ornaments
250  To wield old partisans in hands as old,
251  Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.
252  If ever you disturb our streets again,
253  Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
254  For this time all the rest depart away.
255  You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
256  And, Montague, come you this afternoon
257  To know our farther pleasure in this case,
258  To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
259  Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
260  [All but Montague, Lady Montague,
261  and Benvolio exit.]
262  
263  MONTAGUE, [to Benvolio]
264  Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
265  Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
266  
267  BENVOLIO
268  Here were the servants of your adversary,
269  And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
270  I drew to part them. In the instant came
271  The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,
272  Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
273  He swung about his head and cut the winds,
274  Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
275  While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
276  Came more and more and fought on part and part,
277  Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
278  
279  LADY MONTAGUE
280  O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
281  Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
282  
283  BENVOLIO
284  Madam, an hour before the worshiped sun
285  Peered forth the golden window of the east,
286  A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,
287  Where underneath the grove of sycamore
288  That westward rooteth from this city side,
289  So early walking did I see your son.
290  Towards him I made, but he was 'ware of me
291  And stole into the covert of the wood.
292  I, measuring his affections by my own
293  (Which then most sought where most might not be
294  found,
295  Being one too many by my weary self),
296  Pursued my humor, not pursuing his,
297  And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
298  
299  MONTAGUE
300  Many a morning hath he there been seen,
301  With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
302  Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
303  But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
304  Should in the farthest east begin to draw
305  The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
306  Away from light steals home my heavy son
307  And private in his chamber pens himself,
308  Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
309  And makes himself an artificial night.
310  Black and portentous must this humor prove,
311  Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
312  
313  BENVOLIO
314  My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
315  
316  MONTAGUE
317  I neither know it nor can learn of him.
318  
319  BENVOLIO
320  Have you importuned him by any means?
321  
322  MONTAGUE
323  Both by myself and many other friends.
324  But he, his own affections' counselor,
325  Is to himself--I will not say how true,
326  But to himself so secret and so close,
327  So far from sounding and discovery,
328  As is the bud bit with an envious worm
329  Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
330  Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
331  Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
332  We would as willingly give cure as know.
333  
334  [Enter Romeo.]
335  
336  
337  BENVOLIO
338  See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
339  I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
340  
341  MONTAGUE
342  I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
343  To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away.
344  [Montague and Lady Montague exit.]
345  
346  BENVOLIO
347  Good morrow, cousin.
348  
349  ROMEO  Is the day so young?
350  
351  BENVOLIO
352  But new struck nine.
353  
354  ROMEO  Ay me, sad hours seem long.
355  Was that my father that went hence so fast?
356  
357  BENVOLIO
358  It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
359  
360  ROMEO
361  Not having that which, having, makes them short.
362  
363  BENVOLIO  In love?
364  
365  ROMEO  Out--
366  
367  BENVOLIO  Of love?
368  
369  ROMEO
370  Out of her favor where I am in love.
371  
372  BENVOLIO
373  Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
374  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
375  
376  ROMEO
377  Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
378  Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
379  Where shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?
380  Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
381  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
382  Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
383  O anything of nothing first create!
384  O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
385  Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,
386  Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
387  Still-waking sleep that is not what it is!
388  This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
389  Dost thou not laugh?
390  
391  BENVOLIO  No, coz, I rather weep.
392  
393  ROMEO
394  Good heart, at what?
395  
396  BENVOLIO  At thy good heart's oppression.
397  
398  ROMEO  Why, such is love's transgression.
399  Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
400  Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
401  With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
402  Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
403  Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
404  Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
405  Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
406  What is it else? A madness most discreet,
407  A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
408  Farewell, my coz.
409  
410  BENVOLIO  Soft, I will go along.
411  An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
412  
413  ROMEO
414  Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
415  This is not Romeo. He's some other where.
416  
417  BENVOLIO
418  Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
419  
420  ROMEO  What, shall I groan and tell thee?
421  
422  BENVOLIO
423  Groan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.
424  
425  ROMEO
426  A sick man in sadness makes his will--
427  A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
428  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
429  
430  BENVOLIO
431  I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
432  
433  ROMEO
434  A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
435  
436  BENVOLIO
437  A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
438  
439  ROMEO
440  Well in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
441  With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
442  And, in strong proof of chastity well armed,
443  From love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
444  She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
445  Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
446  Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
447  O, she is rich in beauty, only poor
448  That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
449  
450  BENVOLIO
451  Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
452  
453  ROMEO
454  She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
455  For beauty, starved with her severity,
456  Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
457  She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
458  To merit bliss by making me despair.
459  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
460  Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
461  
462  BENVOLIO
463  Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
464  
465  ROMEO
466  O, teach me how I should forget to think!
467  
468  BENVOLIO
469  By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
470  Examine other beauties.
471  
472  ROMEO  'Tis the way
473  To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
474  These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
475  Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
476  He that is strucken blind cannot forget
477  The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
478  Show me a mistress that is passing fair;
479  What doth her beauty serve but as a note
480  Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
481  Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
482  
483  BENVOLIO
484  I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.
485  [They exit.]
486  
487  Scene 2
488  =======
489  [Enter Capulet, County Paris, and a Servingman.]
490  
491  
492  CAPULET
493  But Montague is bound as well as I,
494  In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard, I think,
495  For men so old as we to keep the peace.
496  
497  PARIS
498  Of honorable reckoning are you both,
499  And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
500  But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
501  
502  CAPULET
503  But saying o'er what I have said before.
504  My child is yet a stranger in the world.
505  She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
506  Let two more summers wither in their pride
507  Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
508  
509  PARIS
510  Younger than she are happy mothers made.
511  
512  CAPULET
513  And too soon marred are those so early made.
514  Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
515  She's the hopeful lady of my earth.
516  But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
517  My will to her consent is but a part.
518  And, she agreed, within her scope of choice
519  Lies my consent and fair according voice.
520  This night I hold an old accustomed feast,
521  Whereto I have invited many a guest
522  Such as I love; and you among the store,
523  One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
524  At my poor house look to behold this night
525  Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
526  Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
527  When well-appareled April on the heel
528  Of limping winter treads, even such delight
529  Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night
530  Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
531  And like her most whose merit most shall be;
532  Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
533  May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
534  Come go with me.	[To Servingman, giving him a list.]
535  Go, sirrah, trudge about
536  Through fair Verona, find those persons out
537  Whose names are written there, and to them say
538  My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
539  [Capulet and Paris exit.]
540  
541  SERVINGMAN  Find them out whose names are written
542  here! It is written that the shoemaker should
543  meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
544  fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.
545  But I am sent to find those persons whose names
546  are here writ, and can never find what names the
547  writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned.
548  In good time!
549  
550  [Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]
551  
552  
553  BENVOLIO, [to Romeo]
554  Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
555  One pain is lessened by another's anguish.
556  Turn giddy, and be helped by backward turning.
557  One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
558  Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
559  And the rank poison of the old will die.
560  
561  ROMEO
562  Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
563  
564  BENVOLIO
565  For what, I pray thee?
566  
567  ROMEO  For your broken shin.
568  
569  BENVOLIO  Why Romeo, art thou mad?
570  
571  ROMEO
572  Not mad, but bound more than a madman is,
573  Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
574  Whipped and tormented, and--good e'en, good
575  fellow.
576  
577  SERVINGMAN  God gi' good e'en. I pray, sir, can you
578  read?
579  
580  ROMEO
581  Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
582  
583  SERVINGMAN  Perhaps you have learned it without
584  book. But I pray, can you read anything you see?
585  
586  ROMEO
587  Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
588  
589  SERVINGMAN  You say honestly. Rest you merry.
590  
591  ROMEO  Stay, fellow. I can read.	[(He reads the letter.)]
592  Signior Martino and his wife and daughters,
593  County Anselme and his beauteous sisters,
594  The lady widow of Vitruvio,
595  Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces,
596  Mercutio and his brother Valentine,
597  Mine Uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters,
598  My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
599  Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,
600  Lucio and the lively Helena.
601  A fair assembly. Whither should they come?
602  
603  SERVINGMAN  Up.
604  
605  ROMEO  Whither? To supper?
606  
607  SERVINGMAN  To our house.
608  
609  ROMEO  Whose house?
610  
611  SERVINGMAN  My master's.
612  
613  ROMEO
614  Indeed I should have asked thee that before.
615  
616  SERVINGMAN  Now I'll tell you without asking. My
617  master is the great rich Capulet, and, if you be not
618  of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a
619  cup of wine. Rest you merry.	[He exits.]
620  
621  BENVOLIO
622  At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
623  Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves,
624  With all the admired beauties of Verona.
625  Go thither, and with unattainted eye
626  Compare her face with some that I shall show,
627  And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
628  
629  ROMEO
630  When the devout religion of mine eye
631  Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
632  And these who, often drowned, could never die,
633  Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
634  One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
635  Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
636  
637  BENVOLIO
638  Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
639  Herself poised with herself in either eye;
640  But in that crystal scales let there be weighed
641  Your lady's love against some other maid
642  That I will show you shining at this feast,
643  And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
644  
645  ROMEO
646  I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
647  But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

651  =======
652  [Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]
653  
654  
655  LADY CAPULET
656  Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
657  
658  NURSE
659  Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
660  I bade her come.--What, lamb! What, ladybird!
661  God forbid. Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
662  
663  [Enter Juliet.]
664  
665  
666  JULIET  How now, who calls?
667  
668  NURSE  Your mother.
669  
670  JULIET
671  Madam, I am here. What is your will?
672  
673  LADY CAPULET
674  This is the matter.--Nurse, give leave awhile.
675  We must talk in secret.--Nurse, come back again.
676  I have remembered me, thou 's hear our counsel.
677  Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
678  
679  NURSE
680  Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
681  
682  LADY CAPULET  She's not fourteen.
683  
684  NURSE  I'll lay fourteen of my teeth (and yet, to my teen
685  be it spoken, I have but four) she's not fourteen.
686  How long is it now to Lammastide?
687  
688  LADY CAPULET  A fortnight and odd days.
689  
690  NURSE
691  Even or odd, of all days in the year,
692  Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
693  Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
694  Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
695  She was too good for me. But, as I said,
696  On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
697  That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.
698  'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,
699  And she was weaned (I never shall forget it)
700  Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
701  For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
702  Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
703  My lord and you were then at Mantua.
704  Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
705  When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
706  Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
707  To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug.
708  "Shake," quoth the dovehouse. 'Twas no need, I
709  trow,
710  To bid me trudge.
711  And since that time it is eleven years.
712  For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th'
713  rood,
714  She could have run and waddled all about,
715  For even the day before, she broke her brow,
716  And then my husband (God be with his soul,
717  He was a merry man) took up the child.
718  "Yea," quoth he, "Dost thou fall upon thy face?
719  Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,
720  Wilt thou not, Jule?" And, by my holidam,
721  The pretty wretch left crying and said "Ay."
722  To see now how a jest shall come about!
723  I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
724  I never should forget it. "Wilt thou not, Jule?"
725  quoth he.
726  And, pretty fool, it stinted and said "Ay."
727  
728  LADY CAPULET
729  Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.
730  
731  NURSE
732  Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh
733  To think it should leave crying and say "Ay."
734  And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
735  A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone,
736  A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
737  "Yea," quoth my husband. "Fall'st upon thy face?
738  Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,
739  Wilt thou not, Jule?" It stinted and said "Ay."
740  
741  JULIET
742  And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
743  
744  NURSE
745  Peace. I have done. God mark thee to his grace,
746  Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
747  An I might live to see thee married once,
748  I have my wish.
749  
750  LADY CAPULET
751  Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
752  I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,
753  How stands your disposition to be married?
754  
755  JULIET
756  It is an honor that I dream not of.
757  
758  NURSE
759  An honor? Were not I thine only nurse,
760  I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy
761  teat.
762  
763  LADY CAPULET
764  Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you
765  Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
766  Are made already mothers. By my count
767  I was your mother much upon these years
768  That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:
769  The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
770  
771  NURSE
772  A man, young lady--lady, such a man
773  As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
774  
775  LADY CAPULET
776  Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
777  
778  NURSE
779  Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.
780  
781  LADY CAPULET
782  What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
783  This night you shall behold him at our feast.
784  Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
785  And find delight writ there with beauty's pen.
786  Examine every married lineament
787  And see how one another lends content,
788  And what obscured in this fair volume lies
789  Find written in the margent of his eyes.
790  This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
791  To beautify him only lacks a cover.
792  The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
793  For fair without the fair within to hide.
794  That book in many's eyes doth share the glory
795  That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.
796  So shall you share all that he doth possess
797  By having him, making yourself no less.
798  
799  NURSE
800  No less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.
801  
802  LADY CAPULET
803  Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris' love?
804  
805  JULIET
806  I'll look to like, if looking liking move.
807  But no more deep will I endart mine eye
808  Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
809  
810  [Enter Servingman.]
811  
812  
813  SERVINGMAN  Madam, the guests are come, supper
814  served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the
815  Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in
816  extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you,
817  follow straight.
818  
819  LADY CAPULET
820  We follow thee.	[Servingman exits.]
821  Juliet, the County stays.

824  Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

827  Scene 4
828  =======
829  [Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other
830  Maskers, Torchbearers, and a Boy with a drum.]
831  
832  
833  ROMEO
834  What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
835  Or shall we on without apology?
836  
837  BENVOLIO
838  The date is out of such prolixity.
839  We'll have no Cupid hoodwinked with a scarf,
840  Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
841  Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper,
842  Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
843  After the prompter, for our entrance.
844  But let them measure us by what they will.
845  We'll measure them a measure and be gone.
846  
847  ROMEO
848  Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
849  Being but heavy I will bear the light.
850  
851  MERCUTIO
852  Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
853  
854  ROMEO
855  Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
856  With nimble soles. I have a soul of lead
857  So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
858  
859  MERCUTIO
860  You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
861  And soar with them above a common bound.
862  
863  ROMEO
864  I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
865  To soar with his light feathers, and so bound
866  I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
867  Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
868  
869  MERCUTIO
870  And to sink in it should you burden love--
871  Too great oppression for a tender thing.
872  
873  ROMEO
874  Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
875  Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
876  
877  MERCUTIO
878  If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
879  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.--
880  Give me a case to put my visage in.--
881  A visor for a visor. What care I
882  What curious eye doth cote deformities?
883  Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
884  
885  BENVOLIO
886  Come, knock and enter, and no sooner in
887  But every man betake him to his legs.
888  
889  ROMEO
890  A torch for me. Let wantons light of heart
891  Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
892  For I am proverbed with a grandsire phrase:
893  I'll be a candle holder and look on;
894  The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
895  
896  MERCUTIO
897  Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word.
898  If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire--
899  Or, save your reverence, love--wherein thou
900  stickest
901  Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
902  
903  ROMEO
904  Nay, that's not so.
905  
906  MERCUTIO  I mean, sir, in delay
907  We waste our lights; in vain, light lights by day.
908  Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
909  Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
910  
911  ROMEO
912  And we mean well in going to this masque,
913  But 'tis no wit to go.
914  
915  MERCUTIO  Why, may one ask?
916  
917  ROMEO
918  I dreamt a dream tonight.
919  
920  MERCUTIO  And so did I.
921  
922  ROMEO
923  Well, what was yours?
924  
925  MERCUTIO  That dreamers often lie.
926  
927  ROMEO
928  In bed asleep while they do dream things true.
929  
930  MERCUTIO
931  O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
932  She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
933  In shape no bigger than an agate stone
934  On the forefinger of an alderman,
935  Drawn with a team of little atomi
936  Over men's noses as they lie asleep.
937  Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
938  The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
939  Her traces of the smallest spider web,
940  Her collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams,
941  Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
942  Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,
943  Not half so big as a round little worm
944  Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.
945  Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
946  Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
947  Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
948  And in this state she gallops night by night
949  Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
950  On courtiers' knees, that dream on cur'sies straight;
951  O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
952  O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
953  Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
954  Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
955  Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
956  And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.
957  And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
958  Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep;
959  Then he dreams of another benefice.
960  Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
961  And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
962  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
963  Of healths five fathom deep, and then anon
964  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes
965  And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
966  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
967  That plats the manes of horses in the night
968  And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
969  Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.
970  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
971  That presses them and learns them first to bear,
972  Making them women of good carriage.
973  This is she--
974  
975  ROMEO  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.
976  Thou talk'st of nothing.
977  
978  MERCUTIO  True, I talk of dreams,
979  Which are the children of an idle brain,
980  Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
981  Which is as thin of substance as the air
982  And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
983  Even now the frozen bosom of the north
984  And, being angered, puffs away from thence,
985  Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
986  
987  BENVOLIO
988  This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
989  Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
990  
991  ROMEO
992  I fear too early, for my mind misgives
993  Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
994  Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
995  With this night's revels, and expire the term
996  Of a despised life closed in my breast
997  By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
998  But he that hath the steerage of my course
999  Direct my sail. On, lusty gentlemen.

1013 
1014 SECOND SERVINGMAN  When good manners shall lie
1015 all in one or two men's hands, and they unwashed

1039 Welcome, gentlemen. Ladies that have their toes
1040 Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with
1041 you.--
1042 Ah, my mistresses, which of you all
1043 Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
1044 She, I'll swear, hath corns. Am I come near you
1045 now?--
1046 Welcome, gentlemen. I have seen the day
1047 That I have worn a visor and could tell
1048 A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
1049 Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone.
1050 You are welcome, gentlemen.--Come, musicians,
1051 play.	[Music plays and they dance.]

1056 Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,

1080 SERVINGMAN  I know not, sir.
1081 
1082 ROMEO
1083 O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
1084 It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
1085 As a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear--
1086 Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.
1087 So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
1088 As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1089 The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
1090 And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1091 Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,
1092 For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

1097 What, dares the slave
1098 Come hither covered with an antic face
1099 To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
1100 Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,
1101 To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

1103 CAPULET
1104 Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
1105 
1106 TYBALT
1107 Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
1108 A villain that is hither come in spite
1109 To scorn at our solemnity this night.

1112 Young Romeo is it?
1113 
1114 TYBALT  'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
1115 
1116 CAPULET
1117 Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone.
1118 He bears him like a portly gentleman,
1119 And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
1120 To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
1121 I would not for the wealth of all this town
1122 Here in my house do him disparagement.
1123 Therefore be patient. Take no note of him.
1124 It is my will, the which if thou respect,
1125 Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
1126 An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
1127 
1128 TYBALT
1129 It fits when such a villain is a guest.
1130 I'll not endure him.
1131 
1132 CAPULET  He shall be endured.
1133 What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to.
1134 Am I the master here or you? Go to.
1135 You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
1136 You'll make a mutiny among my guests,
1137 You will set cock-a-hoop, you'll be the man!

1140 Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
1141 
1142 CAPULET  Go to, go to.
1143 You are a saucy boy. Is 't so indeed?
1144 This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
1145 You must contrary me. Marry, 'tis time--
1146 Well said, my hearts.--You are a princox, go.
1147 Be quiet, or--More light, more light!--for shame,
1148 I'll make you quiet.--What, cheerly, my hearts!
1149 
1150 TYBALT
1151 Patience perforce with willful choler meeting

1157 ROMEO, [taking Juliet's hand]
1158 If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1159 This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:
1160 My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1161 To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
1162 
1163 JULIET
1164 Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1165 Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1166 For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1167 And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
1168 
1169 ROMEO
1170 Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

1173 Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

1179 JULIET
1180 Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
1181 
1182 ROMEO
1183 Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
1184 [He kisses her.]
1185 Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.
1186 
1187 JULIET
1188 Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
1189 
1190 ROMEO
1191 Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
1192 Give me my sin again.	[He kisses her.]
1193 
1194 JULIET  You kiss by th' book.
1195 
1196 NURSE
1197 Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
1198 [Juliet moves toward her mother.]
1199 
1200 ROMEO
1201 What is her mother?
1202 
1203 NURSE  Marry, bachelor,
1204 Her mother is the lady of the house,
1205 And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
1206 I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.
1207 I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
1208 Shall have the chinks.	[Nurse moves away.]
1209 
1210 ROMEO, [aside]  Is she a Capulet?
1211 O dear account! My life is my foe's debt.
1212 
1213 BENVOLIO
1214 Away, begone. The sport is at the best.
1215 
1216 ROMEO
1217 Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.
1218 
1219 CAPULET
1220 Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.
1221 We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.--
1222 Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
1223 I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.--
1224 More torches here.--Come on then, let's to bed.--
1225 Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.
1226 I'll to my rest.
1227 [All but Juliet and the Nurse begin to exit.]
1228 
1229 JULIET
1230 Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1231 
1232 NURSE
1233 The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1234 
1235 JULIET
1236 What's he that now is going out of door?
1237 
1238 NURSE
1239 Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
1240 
1241 JULIET
1242 What's he that follows here, that would not dance?
1243 
1244 NURSE  I know not.
1245 
1246 JULIET
1247 Go ask his name. [The Nurse goes.] If he be married,
1248 My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1249 
1250 NURSE, [returning]
1251 His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
1252 The only son of your great enemy.
1253 
1254 JULIET
1255 My only love sprung from my only hate!
1256 Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1257 Prodigious birth of love it is to me
1258 That I must love a loathed enemy.
1259 
1260 NURSE
1261 What's this? What's this?
1262 
1263 JULIET  A rhyme I learned even now
1264 Of one I danced withal.
1265 [One calls within "Juliet."]
1266 
1267 NURSE  Anon, anon.
1268 Come, let's away. The strangers all are gone.
1269 [They exit.]

1272 ACT 2
1273 =====
1274 
1275 
1276 
1277 [Enter Chorus.]
1278 
1279 
1280 Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
1281 And young affection gapes to be his heir.
1282 That fair for which love groaned for and would die,
1283 With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.
1284 Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1285 Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,
1286 But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1287 And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
1288 Being held a foe, he may not have access
1289 To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
1290 And she as much in love, her means much less
1291 To meet her new beloved anywhere.
1292 But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
1293 Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
1294 [Chorus exits.]
1295 
1296 Scene 1
1297 =======
1298 [Enter Romeo alone.]
1299 
1300 
1301 ROMEO
1302 Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1303 Turn back, dull earth, and find thy center out.
1304 [He withdraws.]
1305 
1306 [Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.]
1307 
1308 BENVOLIO
1309 Romeo, my cousin Romeo, Romeo!
1310 
1311 MERCUTIO  He is wise
1312 And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1313 
1314 BENVOLIO
1315 He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.
1316 Call, good Mercutio.
1317 
1318 MERCUTIO  Nay, I'll conjure too.
1319 Romeo! Humors! Madman! Passion! Lover!
1320 Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.
1321 Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied.
1322 Cry but "Ay me," pronounce but "love" and
1323 "dove."
1324 Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1325 One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
1326 Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
1327 When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.--
1328 He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.
1329 The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--
1330 I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1331 By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip,
1332 By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
1333 And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1334 That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
1335 
1336 BENVOLIO
1337 An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1338 
1339 MERCUTIO
1340 This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
1341 To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1342 Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1343 Till she had laid it and conjured it down.
1344 That were some spite. My invocation
1345 Is fair and honest. In his mistress' name,
1346 I conjure only but to raise up him.
1347 
1348 BENVOLIO
1349 Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
1350 To be consorted with the humorous night.
1351 Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1352 
1353 MERCUTIO
1354 If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1355 Now will he sit under a medlar tree
1356 And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1357 As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.--
1358 O Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1359 An open-arse, thou a pop'rin pear.
1360 Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle bed;
1361 This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.--
1362 Come, shall we go?
1363 
1364 BENVOLIO  Go, then, for 'tis in vain
1365 To seek him here that means not to be found.
1366 [They exit.]
1367 
1368 Scene 2
1369 =======
1370 [Romeo comes forward.]
1371 
1372 
1373 
1374 ROMEO
1375 He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1376 
1377 [Enter Juliet above.]
1378 
1379 But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
1380 It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.
1381 Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1382 Who is already sick and pale with grief
1383 That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
1384 Be not her maid since she is envious.
1385 Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
1386 And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
1387 It is my lady. O, it is my love!
1388 O, that she knew she were!
1389 She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
1390 Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1391 I am too bold. 'Tis not to me she speaks.
1392 Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1393 Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1394 To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1395 What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1396 The brightness of her cheek would shame those
1397 stars
1398 As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven
1399 Would through the airy region stream so bright
1400 That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1401 See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
1402 O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1403 That I might touch that cheek!
1404 
1405 JULIET  Ay me.
1406 
1407 ROMEO, [aside]  She speaks.
1408 O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art
1409 As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
1410 As is a winged messenger of heaven
1411 Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
1412 Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1413 When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds
1414 And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1415 
1416 JULIET
1417 O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
1418 Deny thy father and refuse thy name,
1419 Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1420 And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1421 
1422 ROMEO, [aside]
1423 Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1424 
1425 JULIET
1426 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
1427 Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1428 What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
1429 Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name
1430 Belonging to a man.
1431 What's in a name? That which we call a rose
1432 By any other word would smell as sweet.
1433 So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
1434 Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1435 Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1436 And, for thy name, which is no part of thee,
1437 Take all myself.
1438 
1439 ROMEO  I take thee at thy word.
1440 Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.
1441 Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1442 
1443 JULIET
1444 What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,
1445 So stumblest on my counsel?
1446 
1447 ROMEO  By a name
1448 I know not how to tell thee who I am.
1449 My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
1450 Because it is an enemy to thee.
1451 Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1452 
1453 JULIET
1454 My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
1455 Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.
1456 Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
1457 
1458 ROMEO
1459 Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
1460 
1461 JULIET
1462 How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1463 The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1464 And the place death, considering who thou art,
1465 If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1466 
1467 ROMEO
1468 With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls,
1469 For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1470 And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
1471 Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
1472 
1473 JULIET
1474 If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1475 
1476 ROMEO
1477 Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1478 Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
1479 And I am proof against their enmity.
1480 
1481 JULIET
1482 I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1483 
1484 ROMEO
1485 I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes,
1486 And, but thou love me, let them find me here.
1487 My life were better ended by their hate
1488 Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1489 
1490 JULIET
1491 By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1492 
1493 ROMEO
1494 By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
1495 He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
1496 I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1497 As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
1498 I should adventure for such merchandise.
1499 
1500 JULIET
1501 Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
1502 Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1503 For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
1504 Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny
1505 What I have spoke. But farewell compliment.
1506 Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Ay,"
1507 And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
1508 Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
1509 They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1510 If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
1511 Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
1512 I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
1513 So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.
1514 In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1515 And therefore thou mayst think my havior light.
1516 But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1517 Than those that have more coying to be strange.
1518 I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1519 But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware
1520 My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
1521 And not impute this yielding to light love,
1522 Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1523 
1524 ROMEO
1525 Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
1526 That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1527 
1528 JULIET
1529 O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
1530 That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1531 Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1532 
1533 ROMEO
1534 What shall I swear by?
1535 
1536 JULIET  Do not swear at all.
1537 Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1538 Which is the god of my idolatry,
1539 And I'll believe thee.
1540 
1541 ROMEO  If my heart's dear love--
1542 
1543 JULIET
1544 Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
1545 I have no joy of this contract tonight.
1546 It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,
1547 Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1548 Ere one can say "It lightens." Sweet, good night.
1549 This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1550 May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1551 Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
1552 Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
1553 
1554 ROMEO
1555 O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1556 
1557 JULIET
1558 What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
1559 
1560 ROMEO
1561 Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1562 
1563 JULIET
1564 I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,
1565 And yet I would it were to give again.
1566 
1567 ROMEO
1568 Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
1569 
1570 JULIET
1571 But to be frank and give it thee again.
1572 And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
1573 My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1574 My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
1575 The more I have, for both are infinite.
1576 [Nurse calls from within.]
1577 I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.--
1578 Anon, good nurse.--Sweet Montague, be true.
1579 Stay but a little; I will come again.	[She exits.]
1580 
1581 ROMEO
1582 O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
1583 Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1584 Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
1585 
1586 [Reenter Juliet above.]
1587 
1588 
1589 JULIET
1590 Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1591 If that thy bent of love be honorable,
1592 Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
1593 By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1594 Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
1595 And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1596 And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1597 
1598 NURSE, [within]  Madam.
1599 
1600 JULIET
1601 I come anon.--But if thou meanest not well,
1602 I do beseech thee--
1603 
1604 NURSE, [within]  Madam.
1605 
1606 JULIET  By and by, I come.--
1607 To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
1608 Tomorrow will I send.
1609 
1610 ROMEO  So thrive my soul--
1611 
1612 JULIET  A thousand times good night.	[She exits.]
1613 
1614 ROMEO
1615 A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
1616 Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their
1617 books,
1618 But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1619 [Going.]
1620 
1621 [Enter Juliet above again.]
1622 
1623 
1624 JULIET
1625 Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc'ner's voice
1626 To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1627 Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
1628 Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
1629 And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
1630 With repetition of "My Romeo!"
1631 
1632 ROMEO
1633 It is my soul that calls upon my name.
1634 How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1635 Like softest music to attending ears.
1636 
1637 JULIET
1638 Romeo.
1639 
1640 ROMEO  My dear.
1641 
1642 JULIET  What o'clock tomorrow
1643 Shall I send to thee?
1644 
1645 ROMEO  By the hour of nine.
1646 
1647 JULIET
1648 I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.
1649 I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1650 
1651 ROMEO
1652 Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1653 
1654 JULIET
1655 I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1656 Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
1657 
1658 ROMEO
1659 And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1660 Forgetting any other home but this.
1661 
1662 JULIET
1663 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone,
1664 And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
1665 That lets it hop a little from his hand,
1666 Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1667 And with a silken thread plucks it back again,
1668 So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1669 
1670 ROMEO
1671 I would I were thy bird.
1672 
1673 JULIET  Sweet, so would I.
1674 Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1675 Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet
1676 sorrow
1677 That I shall say "Good night" till it be morrow.
1678 [She exits.]
1679 
1680 ROMEO
1681 Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
1682 Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.
1683 Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell,
1684 His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1685 [He exits.]
1686 
1687 Scene 3
1688 =======
1689 [Enter Friar Lawrence alone with a basket.]
1690 
1691 
1692 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1693 The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1694 Check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1695 And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
1696 From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
1697 Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1698 The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1699 I must upfill this osier cage of ours
1700 With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1701 The Earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1702 What is her burying grave, that is her womb;
1703 And from her womb children of divers kind
1704 We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1705 Many for many virtues excellent,
1706 None but for some, and yet all different.
1707 O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1708 In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
1709 For naught so vile that on the Earth doth live
1710 But to the Earth some special good doth give;
1711 Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,
1712 Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
1713 Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
1714 And vice sometime by action dignified.
1715 
1716 [Enter Romeo.]
1717 
1718 Within the infant rind of this weak flower
1719 Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1720 For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each
1721 part;
1722 Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.
1723 Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1724 In man as well as herbs--grace and rude will;
1725 And where the worser is predominant,
1726 Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1727 
1728 ROMEO
1729 Good morrow, father.
1730 
1731 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Benedicite.
1732 What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1733 Young son, it argues a distempered head
1734 So soon to bid "Good morrow" to thy bed.
1735 Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1736 And, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1737 But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain
1738 Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth
1739 reign.
1740 Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1741 Thou art uproused with some distemp'rature,
1742 Or, if not so, then here I hit it right:
1743 Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
1744 
1745 ROMEO
1746 That last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.
1747 
1748 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1749 God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
1750 
1751 ROMEO
1752 With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
1753 I have forgot that name and that name's woe.
1754 
1755 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1756 That's my good son. But where hast thou been
1757 then?
1758 
1759 ROMEO
1760 I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
1761 I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1762 Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
1763 That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
1764 Within thy help and holy physic lies.
1765 I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1766 My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1767 
1768 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1769 Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.
1770 Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1771 
1772 ROMEO
1773 Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1774 On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
1775 As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
1776 And all combined, save what thou must combine
1777 By holy marriage. When and where and how
1778 We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow
1779 I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,
1780 That thou consent to marry us today.
1781 
1782 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1783 Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1784 Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
1785 So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
1786 Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1787 Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1788 Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1789 How much salt water thrown away in waste
1790 To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1791 The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1792 Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.
1793 Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1794 Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.
1795 If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
1796 Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
1797 And art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence
1798 then:
1799 Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
1800 
1801 ROMEO
1802 Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1803 
1804 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1805 For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1806 
1807 ROMEO
1808 And bad'st me bury love.
1809 
1810 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Not in a grave
1811 To lay one in, another out to have.
1812 
1813 ROMEO
1814 I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now
1815 Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
1816 The other did not so.
1817 
1818 FRIAR LAWRENCE  O, she knew well
1819 Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
1820 But come, young waverer, come, go with me.
1821 In one respect I'll thy assistant be,
1822 For this alliance may so happy prove
1823 To turn your households' rancor to pure love.
1824 
1825 ROMEO
1826 O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.
1827 
1828 FRIAR LAWRENCE
1829 Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.
1830 [They exit.]

1832 Scene 4
1833 =======
1834 [Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]
1835 
1836 
1837 MERCUTIO
1838 Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1839 Came he not home tonight?
1840 
1841 BENVOLIO
1842 Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
1843 
1844 MERCUTIO
1845 Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that
1846 Rosaline,
1847 Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
1848 
1849 BENVOLIO
1850 Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
1851 Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1852 
1853 MERCUTIO  A challenge, on my life.
1854 
1855 BENVOLIO  Romeo will answer it.
1856 
1857 MERCUTIO  Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1858 
1859 BENVOLIO  Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how
1860 he dares, being dared.
1861 
1862 MERCUTIO  Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead,
1863 stabbed with a white wench's black eye, run
1864 through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his
1865 heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt shaft. And
1866 is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
1867 
1868 BENVOLIO  Why, what is Tybalt?
1869 
1870 MERCUTIO  More than prince of cats. O, he's the courageous
1871 captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
1872 prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.
1873 He rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in
1874 your bosom--the very butcher of a silk button, a
1875 duelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house
1876 of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal
1877 passado, the punto reverso, the hay!
1878 
1879 BENVOLIO  The what?
1880 
1881 MERCUTIO  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1882 phantasimes, these new tuners of accent: "By
1883 Jesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good
1884 whore!" Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire,
1885 that we should be thus afflicted with these
1886 strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these "pardon-me" 's,
1887 who stand so much on the new form
1888 that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O their
1889 bones, their bones!
1890 
1891 [Enter Romeo.]
1892 
1893 
1894 BENVOLIO  Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1895 
1896 MERCUTIO  Without his roe, like a dried herring. O
1897 flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the
1898 numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura to his lady
1899 was a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love
1900 to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
1901 Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisbe a gray
1902 eye or so, but not to the purpose.--Signior Romeo,
1903 bonjour. There's a French salutation to your French
1904 slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
1905 
1906 ROMEO  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit
1907 did I give you?
1908 
1909 MERCUTIO  The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
1910 
1911 ROMEO  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was
1912 great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain
1913 courtesy.
1914 
1915 MERCUTIO  That's as much as to say such a case as
1916 yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1917 
1918 ROMEO  Meaning, to curtsy.
1919 
1920 MERCUTIO  Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1921 
1922 ROMEO  A most courteous exposition.
1923 
1924 MERCUTIO  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1925 
1926 ROMEO  "Pink" for flower.
1927 
1928 MERCUTIO  Right.
1929 
1930 ROMEO  Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1931 
1932 MERCUTIO  Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou
1933 hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole
1934 of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing,
1935 solely singular.
1936 
1937 ROMEO  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1938 singleness.
1939 
1940 MERCUTIO  Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits
1941 faints.
1942 
1943 ROMEO  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry
1944 a match.
1945 
1946 MERCUTIO  Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I
1947 am done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in
1948 one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole
1949 five. Was I with you there for the goose?
1950 
1951 ROMEO  Thou wast never with me for anything when
1952 thou wast not there for the goose.
1953 
1954 MERCUTIO  I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1955 
1956 ROMEO  Nay, good goose, bite not.
1957 
1958 MERCUTIO  Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1959 sharp sauce.
1960 
1961 ROMEO  And is it not, then, well served into a sweet
1962 goose?
1963 
1964 MERCUTIO  O, here's a wit of cheveril that stretches
1965 from an inch narrow to an ell broad.
1966 
1967 ROMEO  I stretch it out for that word "broad," which
1968 added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a
1969 broad goose.
1970 
1971 MERCUTIO  Why, is not this better now than groaning
1972 for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou
1973 Romeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as
1974 by nature. For this driveling love is like a great
1975 natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his
1976 bauble in a hole.
1977 
1978 BENVOLIO  Stop there, stop there.
1979 
1980 MERCUTIO  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against
1981 the hair.
1982 
1983 BENVOLIO  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1984 
1985 MERCUTIO  O, thou art deceived. I would have made it
1986 short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale
1987 and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
1988 longer.
1989 
1990 [Enter Nurse and her man Peter.]
1991 
1992 
1993 ROMEO  Here's goodly gear. A sail, a sail!
1994 
1995 MERCUTIO  Two, two--a shirt and a smock.
1996 
1997 NURSE  Peter.
1998 
1999 PETER  Anon.
2000 
2001 NURSE  My fan, Peter.
2002 
2003 MERCUTIO  Good Peter, to hide her face, for her fan's
2004 the fairer face.
2005 
2006 NURSE  God you good morrow, gentlemen.
2007 
2008 MERCUTIO  God you good e'en, fair gentlewoman.
2009 
2010 NURSE  Is it good e'en?
2011 
2012 MERCUTIO  'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of
2013 the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
2014 
2015 NURSE  Out upon you! What a man are you?
2016 
2017 ROMEO  One, gentlewoman, that God hath made, himself
2018 to mar.
2019 
2020 NURSE  By my troth, it is well said: "for himself to
2021 mar," quoth he? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me
2022 where I may find the young Romeo?
2023 
2024 ROMEO  I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older
2025 when you have found him than he was when you
2026 sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for
2027 fault of a worse.
2028 
2029 NURSE  You say well.
2030 
2031 MERCUTIO  Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i'
2032 faith, wisely, wisely.
2033 
2034 NURSE  If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
2035 you.
2036 
2037 BENVOLIO  She will indite him to some supper.
2038 
2039 MERCUTIO  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd. So ho!
2040 
2041 ROMEO  What hast thou found?
2042 
2043 MERCUTIO  No hare, sir, unless a hare, sir, in a Lenten
2044 pie that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
2045 [Singing.]	An old hare hoar,
2046 	And an old hare hoar,
2047 	   Is very good meat in Lent.
2048 	But a hare that is hoar
2049 	Is too much for a score
2050 	   When it hoars ere it be spent.
2051 Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to
2052 dinner thither.
2053 
2054 ROMEO  I will follow you.
2055 
2056 MERCUTIO  Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell, lady, lady,
2057 lady.	[Mercutio and Benvolio exit.]
2058 
2059 NURSE  I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this
2060 that was so full of his ropery?
2061 
2062 ROMEO  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself
2063 talk and will speak more in a minute than he will
2064 stand to in a month.
2065 
2066 NURSE  An he speak anything against me, I'll take him
2067 down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty
2068 such jacks. An if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
2069 Scurvy knave, I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none
2070 of his skains-mates. [To Peter.] And thou must stand
2071 by too and suffer every knave to use me at his
2072 pleasure.
2073 
2074 PETER  I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had,
2075 my weapon should quickly have been out. I warrant
2076 you, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I
2077 see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my
2078 side.
2079 
2080 NURSE  Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part
2081 about me quivers. Scurvy knave! [To Romeo.] Pray
2082 you, sir, a word. And, as I told you, my young lady
2083 bid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will
2084 keep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you
2085 should lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it
2086 were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For
2087 the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you
2088 should deal double with her, truly it were an ill
2089 thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very
2090 weak dealing.
2091 
2092 ROMEO  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.
2093 I protest unto thee--
2094 
2095 NURSE  Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much.
2096 Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
2097 
2098 ROMEO  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not
2099 mark me.
2100 
2101 NURSE  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as
2102 I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2103 
2104 ROMEO  Bid her devise
2105 Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
2106 And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell
2107 Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
2108 [Offering her money.]
2109 
2110 NURSE  No, truly, sir, not a penny.
2111 
2112 ROMEO  Go to, I say you shall.
2113 
2114 NURSE
2115 This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
2116 
2117 ROMEO
2118 And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
2119 Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2120 And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
2121 Which to the high topgallant of my joy
2122 Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2123 Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
2124 Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
2125 
2126 NURSE
2127 Now, God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2128 
2129 ROMEO  What sayst thou, my dear nurse?
2130 
2131 NURSE
2132 Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say
2133 "Two may keep counsel, putting one away"?
2134 
2135 ROMEO
2136 Warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
2137 
2138 NURSE  Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord,
2139 Lord, when 'twas a little prating thing--O, there is
2140 a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay
2141 knife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a
2142 toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes
2143 and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I'll
2144 warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
2145 clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
2146 Romeo begin both with a letter?
2147 
2148 ROMEO  Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.
2149 
2150 NURSE  Ah, mocker, that's the dog's name. R is for
2151 the--No, I know it begins with some other letter,
2152 and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you
2153 and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.
2154 
2155 ROMEO  Commend me to thy lady.
2156 
2157 NURSE  Ay, a thousand times.--Peter.
2158 
2159 PETER  Anon.

2165 =======
2166 [Enter Juliet.]
2167 
2168 
2169 JULIET
2170 The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.
2171 In half an hour she promised to return.
2172 Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
2173 O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
2174 Which ten times faster glides than the sun's beams,
2175 Driving back shadows over louring hills.
2176 Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,
2177 And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2178 Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2179 Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2180 Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
2181 Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2182 She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2183 My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2184 And his to me.
2185 But old folks, many feign as they were dead,
2186 Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
2187 
2188 [Enter Nurse and Peter.]
2189 
2190 O God, she comes!--O, honey nurse, what news?
2191 Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2192 
2193 NURSE  Peter, stay at the gate.	[Peter exits.]
2194 
2195 JULIET
2196 Now, good sweet nurse--O Lord, why lookest thou
2197 sad?
2198 Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.
2199 If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2200 By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2201 
2202 NURSE
2203 I am aweary. Give me leave awhile.
2204 Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!
2205 
2206 JULIET
2207 I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
2208 Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,
2209 speak.
2210 
2211 NURSE
2212 Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
2213 Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2214 
2215 JULIET
2216 How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2217 To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2218 The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2219 Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2220 Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
2221 Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
2222 Let me be satisfied; is 't good or bad?
2223 
2224 NURSE  Well, you have made a simple choice. You know
2225 not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he.
2226 Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg
2227 excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a
2228 body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they
2229 are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy,
2230 but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
2231 ways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at
2232 home?
2233 
2234 JULIET
2235 No, no. But all this did I know before.
2236 What says he of our marriage? What of that?
2237 
2238 NURSE
2239 Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
2240 It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2241 My back o' t' other side! Ah, my back, my back!
2242 Beshrew your heart for sending me about
2243 To catch my death with jaunting up and down.
2244 
2245 JULIET
2246 I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2247 Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my
2248 love?
2249 
2250 NURSE  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
2251 courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
2252 warrant, a virtuous--Where is your mother?
2253 
2254 JULIET
2255 Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
2256 Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest:
2257 "Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2258 Where is your mother?"
2259 
2260 NURSE  O God's lady dear,
2261 Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.
2262 Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2263 Henceforward do your messages yourself.
2264 
2265 JULIET
2266 Here's such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
2267 
2268 NURSE
2269 Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
2270 
2271 JULIET  I have.
2272 
2273 NURSE
2274 Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell.
2275 There stays a husband to make you a wife.
2276 Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks;
2277 They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2278 Hie you to church. I must another way,
2279 To fetch a ladder by the which your love
2280 Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
2281 I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
2282 But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
2283 Go. I'll to dinner. Hie you to the cell.
2284 
2285 JULIET
2286 Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

2290 =======
2291 [Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.]
2292 
2293 
2294 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2295 So smile the heavens upon this holy act
2296 That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
2297 
2298 ROMEO
2299 Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can,
2300 It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2301 That one short minute gives me in her sight.
2302 Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2303 Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
2304 It is enough I may but call her mine.
2305 
2306 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2307 These violent delights have violent ends
2308 And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2309 Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
2310 Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2311 And in the taste confounds the appetite.
2312 Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so.
2313 Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2314 
2315 [Enter Juliet.]
2316 
2317 Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
2318 Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
2319 A lover may bestride the gossamers
2320 That idles in the wanton summer air,
2321 And yet not fall, so light is vanity.
2322 
2323 JULIET
2324 Good even to my ghostly confessor.
2325 
2326 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2327 Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2328 
2329 JULIET
2330 As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2331 
2332 ROMEO
2333 Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2334 Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more
2335 To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2336 This neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue
2337 Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2338 Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2339 
2340 JULIET
2341 Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2342 Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
2343 They are but beggars that can count their worth,
2344 But my true love is grown to such excess
2345 I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2346 
2347 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2348 Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
2349 For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2350 Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
2351 [They exit.]

2354 ACT 3
2355 =====
2356 
2357 Scene 1
2358 =======
2359 [Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and their men.]
2360 
2361 
2362 BENVOLIO
2363 I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
2364 The day is hot, the Capels are abroad,
2365 And if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl,
2366 For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2367 
2368 MERCUTIO  Thou art like one of these fellows that, when
2369 he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his
2370 sword upon the table and says "God send me no
2371 need of thee" and, by the operation of the second
2372 cup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is
2373 no need.
2374 
2375 BENVOLIO  Am I like such a fellow?
2376 
2377 MERCUTIO  Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy
2378 mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be
2379 moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
2380 
2381 BENVOLIO  And what to?
2382 
2383 MERCUTIO  Nay, an there were two such, we should
2384 have none shortly, for one would kill the other.
2385 Thou--why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that
2386 hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than
2387 thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking
2388 nuts, having no other reason but because thou
2389 hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy
2390 out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as
2391 an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been
2392 beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast
2393 quarreled with a man for coughing in the street
2394 because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain
2395 asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor
2396 for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With
2397 another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?
2398 And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?
2399 
2400 BENVOLIO  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any
2401 man should buy the fee simple of my life for an
2402 hour and a quarter.
2403 
2404 MERCUTIO  The fee simple? O simple!
2405 
2406 [Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.]
2407 
2408 
2409 BENVOLIO  By my head, here comes the Capulets.
2410 
2411 MERCUTIO  By my heel, I care not.
2412 
2413 TYBALT, [to his companions]
2414 Follow me close, for I will speak to them.--
2415 Gentlemen, good e'en. A word with one of you.
2416 
2417 MERCUTIO  And but one word with one of us? Couple it
2418 with something. Make it a word and a blow.
2419 
2420 TYBALT  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an
2421 you will give me occasion.
2422 
2423 MERCUTIO  Could you not take some occasion without
2424 giving?
2425 
2426 TYBALT  Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
2427 
2428 MERCUTIO  Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?
2429 An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear
2430 nothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick; here's
2431 that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
2432 
2433 BENVOLIO
2434 We talk here in the public haunt of men.
2435 Either withdraw unto some private place,
2436 Or reason coldly of your grievances,
2437 Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
2438 
2439 MERCUTIO
2440 Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
2441 I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2442 
2443 [Enter Romeo.]
2444 
2445 
2446 TYBALT
2447 Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
2448 
2449 MERCUTIO
2450 But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
2451 Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower.
2452 Your Worship in that sense may call him "man."
2453 
2454 TYBALT
2455 Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
2456 No better term than this: thou art a villain.
2457 
2458 ROMEO
2459 Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2460 Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2461 To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
2462 Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
2463 
2464 TYBALT
2465 Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2466 That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.
2467 
2468 ROMEO
2469 I do protest I never injured thee
2470 But love thee better than thou canst devise
2471 Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
2472 And so, good Capulet, which name I tender
2473 As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
2474 
2475 MERCUTIO
2476 O calm, dishonorable, vile submission!
2477 Alla stoccato carries it away.	[He draws.]
2478 Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
2479 
2480 TYBALT  What wouldst thou have with me?
2481 
2482 MERCUTIO  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your
2483 nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as
2484 you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the
2485 eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher
2486 by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
2487 ears ere it be out.
2488 
2489 TYBALT  I am for you.	[He draws.]
2490 
2491 ROMEO
2492 Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2493 
2494 MERCUTIO  Come, sir, your passado.	[They fight.]
2495 
2496 ROMEO
2497 Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.
2498 [Romeo draws.]
2499 Gentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage!
2500 Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath
2501 Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
2502 Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
2503 [Romeo attempts to beat down their rapiers.
2504 Tybalt stabs Mercutio.]
2505 
2506 PETRUCHIO  Away, Tybalt!
2507 [Tybalt, Petruchio, and their followers exit.]
2508 
2509 MERCUTIO  I am hurt.
2510 A plague o' both houses! I am sped.
2511 Is he gone and hath nothing?
2512 
2513 BENVOLIO  What, art thou hurt?
2514 
2515 MERCUTIO
2516 Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
2517 Where is my page?--Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2518 [Page exits.]
2519 
2520 ROMEO
2521 Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.
2522 
2523 MERCUTIO  No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as
2524 a church door, but 'tis enough. 'Twill serve. Ask for
2525 me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2526 am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2527 both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2528 cat, to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a
2529 villain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the
2530 devil came you between us? I was hurt under your
2531 arm.
2532 
2533 ROMEO  I thought all for the best.
2534 
2535 MERCUTIO
2536 Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2537 Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2538 They have made worms' meat of me.
2539 I have it, and soundly, too. Your houses!
2540 [All but Romeo exit.]
2541 
2542 ROMEO
2543 This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
2544 My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
2545 In my behalf. My reputation stained
2546 With Tybalt's slander--Tybalt, that an hour
2547 Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,
2548 Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2549 And in my temper softened valor's steel.
2550 
2551 [Enter Benvolio.]
2552 
2553 
2554 BENVOLIO
2555 O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.
2556 That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2557 Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2558 
2559 ROMEO
2560 This day's black fate on more days doth depend.
2561 This but begins the woe others must end.
2562 
2563 [Enter Tybalt.]
2564 
2565 
2566 BENVOLIO
2567 Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2568 
2569 ROMEO
2570 Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!
2571 Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2572 And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.--
2573 Now, Tybalt, take the "villain" back again
2574 That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio's soul
2575 Is but a little way above our heads,
2576 Staying for thine to keep him company.
2577 Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
2578 
2579 TYBALT
2580 Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
2581 Shalt with him hence.
2582 
2583 ROMEO  This shall determine that.
2584 [They fight. Tybalt falls.]
2585 
2586 BENVOLIO
2587 Romeo, away, begone!
2588 The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2589 Stand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death
2590 If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away.
2591 
2592 ROMEO
2593 O, I am Fortune's fool!
2594 
2595 BENVOLIO  Why dost thou stay?
2596 [Romeo exits.]
2597 
2598 [Enter Citizens.]
2599 
2600 
2601 CITIZEN
2602 Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?
2603 Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2604 
2605 BENVOLIO
2606 There lies that Tybalt.
2607 
2608 CITIZEN, [to Tybalt]  Up, sir, go with me.
2609 I charge thee in the Prince's name, obey.
2610 
2611 [Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their Wives and all.]
2612 
2613 
2614 PRINCE
2615 Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2616 
2617 BENVOLIO
2618 O noble prince, I can discover all
2619 The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
2620 There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2621 That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2622 
2623 LADY CAPULET
2624 Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child!
2625 O prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled
2626 Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2627 For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2628 O cousin, cousin!
2629 
2630 PRINCE
2631 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2632 
2633 BENVOLIO
2634 Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay--
2635 Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
2636 How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2637 Your high displeasure. All this uttered
2638 With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed
2639 Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2640 Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2641 With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2642 Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point
2643 And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2644 Cold death aside and with the other sends
2645 It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
2646 Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud
2647 "Hold, friends! Friends, part!" and swifter than his
2648 tongue
2649 His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2650 And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2651 An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2652 Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
2653 But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2654 Who had but newly entertained revenge,
2655 And to 't they go like lightning, for ere I
2656 Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,
2657 And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2658 This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2659 
2660 LADY CAPULET
2661 He is a kinsman to the Montague.
2662 Affection makes him false; he speaks not true.
2663 Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2664 And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2665 I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.
2666 Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
2667 
2668 PRINCE
2669 Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
2670 Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2671 
2672 MONTAGUE
2673 Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend.
2674 His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2675 The life of Tybalt.
2676 
2677 PRINCE  And for that offense
2678 Immediately we do exile him hence.
2679 I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding:
2680 My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
2681 But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2682 That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
2683 I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.
2684 Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
2685 Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
2686 Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
2687 Bear hence this body and attend our will.
2688 Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2689 [They exit, the Capulet men
2690 bearing off Tybalt's body.]
2691 
2692 Scene 2
2693 =======
2694 [Enter Juliet alone.]
2695 
2696 
2697 JULIET
2698 Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2699 Towards Phoebus' lodging. Such a wagoner
2700 As Phaeton would whip you to the west
2701 And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2702 Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2703 That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo
2704 Leap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.
2705 Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2706 By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,
2707 It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2708 Thou sober-suited matron all in black,
2709 And learn me how to lose a winning match
2710 Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
2711 Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,
2712 With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,
2713 Think true love acted simple modesty.
2714 Come, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in
2715 night,
2716 For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2717 Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
2718 Come, gentle night; come, loving black-browed
2719 night,
2720 Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
2721 Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2722 And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2723 That all the world will be in love with night
2724 And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2725 O, I have bought the mansion of a love
2726 But not possessed it, and, though I am sold,
2727 Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day
2728 As is the night before some festival
2729 To an impatient child that hath new robes
2730 And may not wear them.
2731 
2732 [Enter Nurse with cords.]
2733 
2734 O, here comes my nurse,
2735 And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
2736 But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--
2737 Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The
2738 cords
2739 That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2740 
2741 NURSE  Ay, ay, the cords.
2742 [Dropping the rope ladder.]
2743 
2744 JULIET
2745 Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
2746 
2747 NURSE
2748 Ah weraday, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2749 We are undone, lady, we are undone.
2750 Alack the day, he's gone, he's killed, he's dead.
2751 
2752 JULIET
2753 Can heaven be so envious?
2754 
2755 NURSE  Romeo can,
2756 Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo,
2757 Whoever would have thought it? Romeo!
2758 
2759 JULIET
2760 What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
2761 This torture should be roared in dismal hell.
2762 Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but "Ay,"
2763 And that bare vowel "I" shall poison more
2764 Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
2765 I am not I if there be such an "I,"
2766 Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "Ay."
2767 If he be slain, say "Ay," or if not, "No."
2768 Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.
2769 
2770 NURSE
2771 I saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes
2772 (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast--
2773 A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,
2774 Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,
2775 All in gore blood. I swooned at the sight.
2776 
2777 JULIET
2778 O break, my heart, poor bankrout, break at once!
2779 To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty.
2780 Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
2781 And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
2782 
2783 NURSE
2784 O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2785 O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,
2786 That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2787 
2788 JULIET
2789 What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2790 Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead?
2791 My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
2792 Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom,
2793 For who is living if those two are gone?
2794 
2795 NURSE
2796 Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished.
2797 Romeo that killed him--he is banished.
2798 
2799 JULIET
2800 O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2801 
2802 NURSE
2803 It did, it did, alas the day, it did.
2804 
2805 JULIET
2806 O serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face!
2807 Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2808 Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical!
2809 Dove-feathered raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
2810 Despised substance of divinest show!
2811 Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2812 A damned saint, an honorable villain.
2813 O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
2814 When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2815 In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
2816 Was ever book containing such vile matter
2817 So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
2818 In such a gorgeous palace!
2819 
2820 NURSE  There's no trust,
2821 No faith, no honesty in men. All perjured,
2822 All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2823 Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
2824 These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me
2825 old.
2826 Shame come to Romeo!
2827 
2828 JULIET  Blistered be thy tongue
2829 For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
2830 Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,
2831 For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned
2832 Sole monarch of the universal Earth.
2833 O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2834 
2835 NURSE
2836 Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
2837 
2838 JULIET
2839 Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2840 Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy
2841 name
2842 When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2843 But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2844 That villain cousin would have killed my husband.
2845 Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2846 Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2847 Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2848 My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
2849 And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my
2850 husband.
2851 All this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?
2852 Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2853 That murdered me. I would forget it fain,
2854 But, O, it presses to my memory
2855 Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2856 "Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished."
2857 That "banished," that one word "banished,"
2858 Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2859 Was woe enough if it had ended there;
2860 Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2861 And needly will be ranked with other griefs,
2862 Why followed not, when she said "Tybalt's dead,"
2863 "Thy father" or "thy mother," nay, or both,
2864 Which modern lamentation might have moved?
2865 But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
2866 "Romeo is banished." To speak that word
2867 Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2868 All slain, all dead. "Romeo is banished."
2869 There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2870 In that word's death. No words can that woe sound.
2871 Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
2872 
2873 NURSE
2874 Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
2875 Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2876 
2877 JULIET
2878 Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be
2879 spent,
2880 When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.--
2881 Take up those cords.
2882 [The Nurse picks up the rope ladder.]
2883 Poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2884 Both you and I, for Romeo is exiled.
2885 He made you for a highway to my bed,
2886 But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2887 Come, cords--come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed,
2888 And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2889 
2890 NURSE
2891 Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
2892 To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
2893 Hark you, your Romeo will be here at night.
2894 I'll to him. He is hid at Lawrence' cell.
2895 
2896 JULIET
2897 O, find him!	[Giving the Nurse a ring.]
2898 Give this ring to my true knight
2899 And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2900 [They exit.]

2902 Scene 3
2903 =======
2904 [Enter Friar Lawrence.]
2905 
2906 
2907 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2908 Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
2909 Affliction is enamored of thy parts,
2910 And thou art wedded to calamity.
2911 
2912 [Enter Romeo.]
2913 
2914 
2915 ROMEO
2916 Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom?
2917 What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
2918 That I yet know not?
2919 
2920 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Too familiar
2921 Is my dear son with such sour company.
2922 I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
2923 
2924 ROMEO
2925 What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
2926 
2927 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2928 A gentler judgment vanished from his lips:
2929 Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2930 
2931 ROMEO
2932 Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say "death,"
2933 For exile hath more terror in his look,
2934 Much more than death. Do not say "banishment."
2935 
2936 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2937 Here from Verona art thou banished.
2938 Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2939 
2940 ROMEO
2941 There is no world without Verona walls
2942 But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2943 Hence "banished" is "banished from the world,"
2944 And world's exile is death. Then "banished"
2945 Is death mistermed. Calling death "banished,"
2946 Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax
2947 And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2948 
2949 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2950 O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
2951 Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,
2952 Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law
2953 And turned that black word "death" to
2954 "banishment."
2955 This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2956 
2957 ROMEO
2958 'Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here
2959 Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog
2960 And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2961 Live here in heaven and may look on her,
2962 But Romeo may not. More validity,
2963 More honorable state, more courtship lives
2964 In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
2965 On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2966 And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2967 Who even in pure and vestal modesty
2968 Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2969 But Romeo may not; he is banished.
2970 Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.
2971 They are free men, but I am banished.
2972 And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
2973 Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground
2974 knife,
2975 No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2976 But "banished" to kill me? "Banished"?
2977 O friar, the damned use that word in hell.
2978 Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
2979 Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2980 A sin absolver, and my friend professed,
2981 To mangle me with that word "banished"?
2982 
2983 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2984 Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
2985 
2986 ROMEO
2987 O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2988 
2989 FRIAR LAWRENCE
2990 I'll give thee armor to keep off that word,
2991 Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2992 To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2993 
2994 ROMEO
2995 Yet "banished"? Hang up philosophy.
2996 Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2997 Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2998 It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
2999 
3000 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3001 O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
3002 
3003 ROMEO
3004 How should they when that wise men have no eyes?
3005 
3006 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3007 Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
3008 
3009 ROMEO
3010 Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
3011 Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
3012 An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
3013 Doting like me, and like me banished,
3014 Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy
3015 hair
3016 And fall upon the ground as I do now,
3017 [Romeo throws himself down.]
3018 Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
3019 [Knock within.]
3020 
3021 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3022 Arise. One knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
3023 
3024 ROMEO
3025 Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,
3026 Mistlike, enfold me from the search of eyes.
3027 [Knock.]
3028 
3029 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3030 Hark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo,
3031 arise.
3032 Thou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile.--Stand up.
3033 [Knock.]
3034 Run to my study.--By and by.--God's will,
3035 What simpleness is this?--I come, I come.
3036 [Knock.]
3037 Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's
3038 your will?
3039 
3040 NURSE, [within]
3041 Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
3042 I come from Lady Juliet.
3043 
3044 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [admitting the Nurse]
3045 Welcome, then.
3046 
3047 [Enter Nurse.]
3048 
3049 
3050 NURSE
3051 O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
3052 Where's my lady's lord? Where's Romeo?
3053 
3054 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3055 There on the ground, with his own tears made
3056 drunk.
3057 
3058 NURSE
3059 O, he is even in my mistress' case,
3060 Just in her case. O woeful sympathy!
3061 Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
3062 Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubb'ring.--
3063 Stand up, stand up. Stand an you be a man.
3064 For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
3065 Why should you fall into so deep an O?
3066 
3067 ROMEO  Nurse.
3068 
3069 NURSE
3070 Ah sir, ah sir, death's the end of all.
3071 
3072 ROMEO, [rising up]
3073 Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
3074 Doth not she think me an old murderer,
3075 Now I have stained the childhood of our joy
3076 With blood removed but little from her own?
3077 Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
3078 My concealed lady to our canceled love?
3079 
3080 NURSE
3081 O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,
3082 And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
3083 And "Tybalt" calls, and then on Romeo cries,
3084 And then down falls again.
3085 
3086 ROMEO  As if that name,
3087 Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
3088 Did murder her, as that name's cursed hand
3089 Murdered her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,
3090 In what vile part of this anatomy
3091 Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
3092 The hateful mansion.	[He draws his dagger.]
3093 
3094 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Hold thy desperate hand!
3095 Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
3096 Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
3097 The unreasonable fury of a beast.
3098 Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
3099 And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
3100 Thou hast amazed me. By my holy order,
3101 I thought thy disposition better tempered.
3102 Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself,
3103 And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
3104 By doing damned hate upon thyself?
3105 Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth,
3106 Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
3107 In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?
3108 Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
3109 Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all
3110 And usest none in that true use indeed
3111 Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
3112 Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
3113 Digressing from the valor of a man;
3114 Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
3115 Killing that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;
3116 Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
3117 Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
3118 Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
3119 Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
3120 And thou dismembered with thine own defense.
3121 What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
3122 For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead:
3123 There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
3124 But thou slewest Tybalt: there art thou happy.
3125 The law that threatened death becomes thy friend
3126 And turns it to exile: there art thou happy.
3127 A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
3128 Happiness courts thee in her best array;
3129 But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
3130 Thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love.
3131 Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
3132 Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.
3133 Ascend her chamber. Hence and comfort her.
3134 But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
3135 For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
3136 Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
3137 To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
3138 Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
3139 With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
3140 Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.--
3141 Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
3142 And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
3143 Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
3144 Romeo is coming.
3145 
3146 NURSE
3147 O Lord, I could have stayed here all the night
3148 To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!--
3149 My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
3150 
3151 ROMEO
3152 Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
3153 
3154 NURSE
3155 Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
3156 [Nurse gives Romeo a ring.]
3157 Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
3158 [She exits.]
3159 
3160 ROMEO
3161 How well my comfort is revived by this!
3162 
3163 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3164 Go hence, good night--and here stands all your
3165 state:
3166 Either be gone before the watch be set
3167 Or by the break of day disguised from hence.
3168 Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
3169 And he shall signify from time to time
3170 Every good hap to you that chances here.
3171 Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell. Good night.
3172 
3173 ROMEO
3174 But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
3175 It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
3176 Farewell.
3177 [They exit.]

3179 Scene 4
3180 =======
3181 [Enter old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.]
3182 
3183 
3184 CAPULET
3185 Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
3186 That we have had no time to move our daughter.
3187 Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
3188 And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
3189 'Tis very late. She'll not come down tonight.
3190 I promise you, but for your company,
3191 I would have been abed an hour ago.
3192 
3193 PARIS
3194 These times of woe afford no times to woo.--
3195 Madam, good night. Commend me to your
3196 daughter.
3197 
3198 LADY CAPULET
3199 I will, and know her mind early tomorrow.
3200 Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.
3201 
3202 CAPULET
3203 Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
3204 Of my child's love. I think she will be ruled
3205 In all respects by me. Nay, more, I doubt it not.--
3206 Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed.
3207 Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love,
3208 And bid her--mark you me?--on Wednesday
3209 next--
3210 But soft, what day is this?
3211 
3212 PARIS  Monday, my lord.
3213 
3214 CAPULET
3215 Monday, ha ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
3216 O' Thursday let it be.--O' Thursday, tell her,
3217 She shall be married to this noble earl.--
3218 Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
3219 We'll keep no great ado: a friend or two.
3220 For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3221 It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3222 Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
3223 Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
3224 And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
3225 
3226 PARIS
3227 My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
3228 
3229 CAPULET
3230 Well, get you gone. O' Thursday be it, then.
3231 [To Lady Capulet.] Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.
3232 Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.--
3233 Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!--
3234 Afore me, it is so very late that we
3235 May call it early by and by.--Good night.
3236 [They exit.]

3238 Scene 5
3239 =======
3240 [Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft.]
3241 
3242 
3243 JULIET
3244 Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
3245 It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3246 That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
3247 Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
3248 Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
3249 
3250 ROMEO
3251 It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
3252 No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
3253 Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
3254 Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
3255 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.
3256 I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
3257 
3258 JULIET
3259 Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
3260 It is some meteor that the sun exhaled
3261 To be to thee this night a torchbearer
3262 And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
3263 Therefore stay yet. Thou need'st not to be gone.
3264 
3265 ROMEO
3266 Let me be ta'en; let me be put to death.
3267 I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
3268 I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye;
3269 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow.
3270 Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
3271 The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
3272 I have more care to stay than will to go.
3273 Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
3274 How is 't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.
3275 
3276 JULIET
3277 It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!
3278 It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3279 Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3280 Some say the lark makes sweet division.
3281 This doth not so, for she divideth us.
3282 Some say the lark and loathed toad changed eyes.
3283 O, now I would they had changed voices too,
3284 Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3285 Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
3286 O, now begone. More light and light it grows.
3287 
3288 ROMEO
3289 More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
3290 
3291 [Enter Nurse.]
3292 
3293 
3294 NURSE  Madam.
3295 
3296 JULIET  Nurse?
3297 
3298 NURSE
3299 Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
3300 The day is broke; be wary; look about.	[She exits.]
3301 
3302 JULIET
3303 Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
3304 
3305 ROMEO
3306 Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I'll descend.
3307 [They kiss, and Romeo descends.]
3308 
3309 JULIET
3310 Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend!
3311 I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
3312 For in a minute there are many days.
3313 O, by this count I shall be much in years
3314 Ere I again behold my Romeo.
3315 
3316 ROMEO  Farewell.
3317 I will omit no opportunity
3318 That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
3319 
3320 JULIET
3321 O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
3322 
3323 ROMEO
3324 I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
3325 For sweet discourses in our times to come.
3326 
3327 JULIET
3328 O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
3329 Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
3330 As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
3331 Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale.
3332 
3333 ROMEO
3334 And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
3335 Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.	[He exits.]
3336 
3337 JULIET
3338 O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.
3339 If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
3340 That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
3341 For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,
3342 But send him back.
3343 
3344 [Enter Lady Capulet.]
3345 
3346 
3347 LADY CAPULET  Ho, daughter, are you up?
3348 
3349 JULIET
3350 Who is 't that calls? It is my lady mother.
3351 Is she not down so late or up so early?
3352 What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
3353 [Juliet descends.]
3354 
3355 LADY CAPULET
3356 Why, how now, Juliet?
3357 
3358 JULIET  Madam, I am not well.
3359 
3360 LADY CAPULET
3361 Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
3362 What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
3363 An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
3364 Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of
3365 love,
3366 But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
3367 
3368 JULIET
3369 Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
3370 
3371 LADY CAPULET
3372 So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
3373 Which you weep for.
3374 
3375 JULIET  Feeling so the loss,
3376 I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
3377 
3378 LADY CAPULET
3379 Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
3380 As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
3381 
3382 JULIET
3383 What villain, madam?
3384 
3385 LADY CAPULET  That same villain, Romeo.
3386 
3387 JULIET, [aside]
3388 Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
3389 God pardon him. I do with all my heart,
3390 And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
3391 
3392 LADY CAPULET
3393 That is because the traitor murderer lives.
3394 
3395 JULIET
3396 Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
3397 Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
3398 
3399 LADY CAPULET
3400 We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
3401 Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
3402 Where that same banished runagate doth live,
3403 Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram
3404 That he shall soon keep Tybalt company.
3405 And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
3406 
3407 JULIET
3408 Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
3409 With Romeo till I behold him--dead--
3410 Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.
3411 Madam, if you could find out but a man
3412 To bear a poison, I would temper it,
3413 That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
3414 Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
3415 To hear him named and cannot come to him
3416 To wreak the love I bore my cousin
3417 Upon his body that hath slaughtered him.
3418 
3419 LADY CAPULET
3420 Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
3421 But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
3422 
3423 JULIET
3424 And joy comes well in such a needy time.
3425 What are they, beseech your Ladyship?
3426 
3427 LADY CAPULET
3428 Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,
3429 One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
3430 Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
3431 That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.
3432 
3433 JULIET
3434 Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
3435 
3436 LADY CAPULET
3437 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
3438 The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
3439 The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church
3440 Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
3441 
3442 JULIET
3443 Now, by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
3444 He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
3445 I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
3446 Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
3447 I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
3448 I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear
3449 It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
3450 Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
3451 
3452 LADY CAPULET
3453 Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
3454 And see how he will take it at your hands.
3455 
3456 [Enter Capulet and Nurse.]
3457 
3458 
3459 CAPULET
3460 When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,
3461 But for the sunset of my brother's son
3462 It rains downright.
3463 How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
3464 Evermore show'ring? In one little body
3465 Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
3466 For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
3467 Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
3468 Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,
3469 Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
3470 Without a sudden calm, will overset
3471 Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife?
3472 Have you delivered to her our decree?
3473 
3474 LADY CAPULET
3475 Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.
3476 I would the fool were married to her grave.
3477 
3478 CAPULET
3479 Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.
3480 How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
3481 Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,
3482 Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
3483 So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?
3484 
3485 JULIET
3486 Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
3487 Proud can I never be of what I hate,
3488 But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
3489 
3490 CAPULET
3491 How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?
3492 "Proud," and "I thank you," and "I thank you not,"
3493 And yet "not proud"? Mistress minion you,
3494 Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
3495 But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
3496 To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
3497 Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
3498 Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
3499 You tallow face!
3500 
3501 LADY CAPULET  Fie, fie, what, are you mad?
3502 
3503 JULIET, [kneeling]
3504 Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
3505 Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
3506 
3507 CAPULET
3508 Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!
3509 I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
3510 Or never after look me in the face.
3511 Speak not; reply not; do not answer me.
3512 My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us
3513 blessed
3514 That God had lent us but this only child,
3515 But now I see this one is one too much,
3516 And that we have a curse in having her.
3517 Out on her, hilding.
3518 
3519 NURSE  God in heaven bless her!
3520 You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3521 
3522 CAPULET
3523 And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue.
3524 Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.
3525 
3526 NURSE
3527 I speak no treason.
3528 
3529 CAPULET  O, God 'i' g' eden!
3530 
3531 NURSE
3532 May not one speak?
3533 
3534 CAPULET  Peace, you mumbling fool!
3535 Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
3536 For here we need it not.
3537 
3538 LADY CAPULET  You are too hot.
3539 
3540 CAPULET  God's bread, it makes me mad.
3541 Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
3542 Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3543 To have her matched. And having now provided
3544 A gentleman of noble parentage,
3545 Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ligned,
3546 Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,
3547 Proportioned as one's thought would wish a man--
3548 And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3549 A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3550 To answer "I'll not wed. I cannot love.
3551 I am too young. I pray you, pardon me."
3552 But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you!
3553 Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
3554 Look to 't; think on 't. I do not use to jest.
3555 Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart; advise.
3556 An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.
3557 An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
3558 For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3559 Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
3560 Trust to 't; bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.
3561 [He exits.]
3562 
3563 JULIET
3564 Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
3565 That sees into the bottom of my grief?--
3566 O sweet my mother, cast me not away.
3567 Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
3568 Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3569 In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3570 
3571 LADY CAPULET
3572 Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
3573 Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3574 [She exits.]
3575 
3576 JULIET, [rising]
3577 O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
3578 My husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven.
3579 How shall that faith return again to Earth
3580 Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3581 By leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.--
3582 Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems
3583 Upon so soft a subject as myself.--
3584 What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
3585 Some comfort, nurse.
3586 
3587 NURSE  Faith, here it is.
3588 Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing
3589 That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you,
3590 Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3591 Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3592 I think it best you married with the County.
3593 O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3594 Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
3595 Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3596 As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3597 I think you are happy in this second match,
3598 For it excels your first, or, if it did not,
3599 Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were
3600 As living here and you no use of him.
3601 
3602 JULIET
3603 Speak'st thou from thy heart?
3604 
3605 NURSE
3606 And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.
3607 
3608 JULIET  Amen.
3609 
3610 NURSE  What?
3611 
3612 JULIET
3613 Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.
3614 Go in and tell my lady I am gone,
3615 Having displeased my father, to Lawrence' cell
3616 To make confession and to be absolved.
3617 
3618 NURSE
3619 Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.	[She exits.]
3620 
3621 JULIET
3622 Ancient damnation, O most wicked fiend!
3623 Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
3624 Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3625 Which she hath praised him with above compare
3626 So many thousand times? Go, counselor.
3627 Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3628 I'll to the Friar to know his remedy.
3629 If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3630 [She exits.]

3633 ACT 4
3634 =====
3635 
3636 Scene 1
3637 =======
3638 [Enter Friar Lawrence and County Paris.]
3639 
3640 
3641 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3642 On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
3643 
3644 PARIS
3645 My father Capulet will have it so,
3646 And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3647 
3648 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3649 You say you do not know the lady's mind?
3650 Uneven is the course. I like it not.
3651 
3652 PARIS
3653 Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3654 And therefore have I little talk of love,
3655 For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3656 Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3657 That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
3658 And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
3659 To stop the inundation of her tears,
3660 Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3661 May be put from her by society.
3662 Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3663 
3664 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [aside]
3665 I would I knew not why it should be slowed.--
3666 Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
3667 
3668 [Enter Juliet.]
3669 
3670 
3671 PARIS
3672 Happily met, my lady and my wife.
3673 
3674 JULIET
3675 That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3676 
3677 PARIS
3678 That "may be" must be, love, on Thursday next.
3679 
3680 JULIET
3681 What must be shall be.
3682 
3683 FRIAR LAWRENCE  That's a certain text.
3684 
3685 PARIS
3686 Come you to make confession to this father?
3687 
3688 JULIET
3689 To answer that, I should confess to you.
3690 
3691 PARIS
3692 Do not deny to him that you love me.
3693 
3694 JULIET
3695 I will confess to you that I love him.
3696 
3697 PARIS
3698 So will you, I am sure, that you love me.
3699 
3700 JULIET
3701 If I do so, it will be of more price
3702 Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
3703 
3704 PARIS
3705 Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3706 
3707 JULIET
3708 The tears have got small victory by that,
3709 For it was bad enough before their spite.
3710 
3711 PARIS
3712 Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
3713 
3714 JULIET
3715 That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
3716 And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3717 
3718 PARIS
3719 Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.
3720 
3721 JULIET
3722 It may be so, for it is not mine own.--
3723 Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
3724 Or shall I come to you at evening Mass?
3725 
3726 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3727 My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.--
3728 My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3729 
3730 PARIS
3731 God shield I should disturb devotion!--
3732 Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.
3733 Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.	[He exits.]
3734 
3735 JULIET
3736 O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
3737 Come weep with me, past hope, past care, past help.
3738 
3739 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3740 O Juliet, I already know thy grief.
3741 It strains me past the compass of my wits.
3742 I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3743 On Thursday next be married to this County.
3744 
3745 JULIET
3746 Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,
3747 Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
3748 If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
3749 Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3750 And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3751 [She shows him her knife.]
3752 God joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3753 And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's sealed,
3754 Shall be the label to another deed,
3755 Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3756 Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
3757 Therefore out of thy long-experienced time
3758 Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3759 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3760 Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3761 Which the commission of thy years and art
3762 Could to no issue of true honor bring.
3763 Be not so long to speak. I long to die
3764 If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3765 
3766 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3767 Hold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,
3768 Which craves as desperate an execution
3769 As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3770 If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3771 Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3772 Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3773 A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3774 That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;
3775 And if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3776 
3777 JULIET
3778 O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3779 From off the battlements of any tower,
3780 Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
3781 Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears,
3782 Or hide me nightly in a charnel house,
3783 O'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3784 With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
3785 Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3786 And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
3787 (Things that to hear them told have made me
3788 tremble),
3789 And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3790 To live an unstained wife to my sweet love.
3791 
3792 FRIAR LAWRENCE
3793 Hold, then. Go home; be merry; give consent
3794 To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow.
3795 Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone;
3796 Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
3797 [Holding out a vial.]
3798 Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3799 And this distilling liquor drink thou off;
3800 When presently through all thy veins shall run
3801 A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse
3802 Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
3803 No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest.
3804 The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3805 To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
3806 Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
3807 Each part, deprived of supple government,
3808 Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,
3809 And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
3810 Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
3811 And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3812 Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3813 To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
3814 Then, as the manner of our country is,
3815 In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
3816 Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3817 Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3818 In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
3819 Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3820 And hither shall he come, and he and I
3821 Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3822 Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3823 And this shall free thee from this present shame,
3824 If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
3825 Abate thy valor in the acting it.
3826 
3827 JULIET
3828 Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3829 
3830 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [giving Juliet the vial]
3831 Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous
3832 In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
3833 To Mantua with my letters to thy lord.
3834 
3835 JULIET
3836 Love give me strength, and strength shall help
3837 afford.
3838 Farewell, dear father.

3843 [Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
3844 two or three.]
3845 
3846 
3847 CAPULET
3848 So many guests invite as here are writ.
3849 [One or two of the Servingmen exit
3850 with Capulet's list.]
3851 Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3852 
3853 SERVINGMAN  You shall have none ill, sir, for I'll try if
3854 they can lick their fingers.
3855 
3856 CAPULET  How canst thou try them so?
3857 
3858 SERVINGMAN  Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick
3859 his own fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his
3860 fingers goes not with me.
3861 
3862 CAPULET  Go, begone.	[Servingman exits.]
3863 We shall be much unfurnished for this time.--
3864 What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
3865 
3866 NURSE  Ay, forsooth.
3867 
3868 CAPULET
3869 Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
3870 A peevish self-willed harlotry it is.
3871 
3872 [Enter Juliet.]
3873 
3874 
3875 NURSE
3876 See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3877 
3878 CAPULET
3879 How now, my headstrong, where have you been
3880 gadding?
3881 
3882 JULIET
3883 Where I have learned me to repent the sin
3884 Of disobedient opposition
3885 To you and your behests, and am enjoined
3886 By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here	[Kneeling.]
3887 To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.
3888 Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3889 
3890 CAPULET
3891 Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
3892 I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
3893 
3894 JULIET
3895 I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell
3896 And gave him what becomed love I might,
3897 Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
3898 
3899 CAPULET
3900 Why, I am glad on 't. This is well. Stand up.
3901 [Juliet rises.]
3902 This is as 't should be.--Let me see the County.
3903 Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--
3904 Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
3905 All our whole city is much bound to him.
3906 
3907 JULIET
3908 Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
3909 To help me sort such needful ornaments
3910 As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
3911 
3912 LADY CAPULET
3913 No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
3914 
3915 CAPULET
3916 Go, nurse. Go with her. We'll to church tomorrow.
3917 [Juliet and the Nurse exit.]
3918 
3919 LADY CAPULET
3920 We shall be short in our provision.
3921 'Tis now near night.
3922 
3923 CAPULET  Tush, I will stir about,
3924 And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
3925 Go thou to Juliet. Help to deck up her.
3926 I'll not to bed tonight. Let me alone.
3927 I'll play the housewife for this once.--What ho!--
3928 They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3929 To County Paris, to prepare up him
3930 Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light
3931 Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.

3938 
3939 JULIET
3940 Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle nurse,
3941 I pray thee leave me to myself tonight,
3942 For I have need of many orisons
3943 To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3944 Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
3945 
3946 [Enter Lady Capulet.]
3947 
3948 
3949 LADY CAPULET
3950 What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
3951 
3952 JULIET
3953 No, madam, we have culled such necessaries
3954 As are behooveful for our state tomorrow.
3955 So please you, let me now be left alone,
3956 And let the Nurse this night sit up with you,
3957 For I am sure you have your hands full all
3958 In this so sudden business.
3959 
3960 LADY CAPULET  Good night.
3961 Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
3962 [Lady Capulet and the Nurse exit.]
3963 
3964 JULIET
3965 Farewell.--God knows when we shall meet again.
3966 I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
3967 That almost freezes up the heat of life.
3968 I'll call them back again to comfort me.--
3969 Nurse!--What should she do here?
3970 My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3971 Come, vial.	[She takes out the vial.]
3972 What if this mixture do not work at all?
3973 Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
3974 [She takes out her knife
3975 and puts it down beside her.]
3976 No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
3977 What if it be a poison which the Friar
3978 Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,
3979 Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored
3980 Because he married me before to Romeo?
3981 I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
3982 For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3983 How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3984 I wake before the time that Romeo
3985 Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point.
3986 Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
3987 To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3988 And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3989 Or, if I live, is it not very like
3990 The horrible conceit of death and night,
3991 Together with the terror of the place--
3992 As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
3993 Where for this many hundred years the bones
3994 Of all my buried ancestors are packed;
3995 Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3996 Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
3997 At some hours in the night spirits resort--
3998 Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3999 So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
4000 And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
4001 That living mortals, hearing them, run mad--
4002 O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
4003 Environed with all these hideous fears,
4004 And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
4005 And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,
4006 And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
4007 As with a club, dash out my desp'rate brains?
4008 O look, methinks I see my cousin's ghost
4009 Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
4010 Upon a rapier's point! Stay, Tybalt, stay!
4011 Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's drink. I drink to
4012 thee.	[She drinks and falls upon her bed
4013 within the curtains.]

4019 
4020 LADY CAPULET
4021 Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
4022 
4023 NURSE
4024 They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
4025 
4026 [Enter old Capulet.]
4027 
4028 
4029 CAPULET
4030 Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crowed.
4031 The curfew bell hath rung. 'Tis three o'clock.--
4032 Look to the baked meats, good Angelica.
4033 Spare not for cost.
4034 
4035 NURSE  Go, you cot-quean, go,
4036 Get you to bed. Faith, you'll be sick tomorrow
4037 For this night's watching.
4038 
4039 CAPULET
4040 No, not a whit. What, I have watched ere now
4041 All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
4042 
4043 LADY CAPULET
4044 Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,
4045 But I will watch you from such watching now.
4046 [Lady Capulet and Nurse exit.]
4047 
4048 CAPULET
4049 A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
4050 
4051 [Enter three or four Servingmen with spits and logs
4052 and baskets.]
4053 
4054 Now fellow,
4055 What is there?
4056 
4057 FIRST SERVINGMAN
4058 Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.
4059 
4060 CAPULET
4061 Make haste, make haste.	[First Servingman exits.]
4062 Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
4063 Call Peter. He will show thee where they are.
4064 
4065 SECOND SERVINGMAN
4066 I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
4067 And never trouble Peter for the matter.
4068 
4069 CAPULET
4070 Mass, and well said. A merry whoreson, ha!
4071 Thou shalt be loggerhead.
4072 [Second Servingman exits.]
4073 Good faith, 'tis day.
4074 The County will be here with music straight,
4075 [Play music.]
4076 For so he said he would. I hear him near.--
4077 Nurse!--Wife! What ho!--What, nurse, I say!
4078 
4079 [Enter Nurse.]
4080 
4081 Go waken Juliet. Go and trim her up.
4082 I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
4083 Make haste. The bridegroom he is come already.
4084 Make haste, I say.

4090 NURSE, [approaching the bed]
4091 Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet!--Fast, I warrant
4092 her, she--
4093 Why, lamb, why, lady! Fie, you slugabed!
4094 Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!--
4095 What, not a word?--You take your pennyworths
4096 now.
4097 Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,
4098 The County Paris hath set up his rest
4099 That you shall rest but little.--God forgive me,
4100 Marry, and amen! How sound is she asleep!
4101 I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!
4102 Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
4103 He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?
4104 [She opens the bed's curtains.]
4105 What, dressed, and in your clothes, and down
4106 again?
4107 I must needs wake you. Lady, lady, lady!--
4108 Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead.--
4109 O, weraday, that ever I was born!--
4110 Some aqua vitae, ho!--My lord! My lady!
4111 
4112 [Enter Lady Capulet.]
4113 
4114 
4115 LADY CAPULET
4116 What noise is here?
4117 
4118 NURSE  O lamentable day!
4119 
4120 LADY CAPULET
4121 What is the matter?
4122 
4123 NURSE  Look, look!--O heavy day!
4124 
4125 LADY CAPULET
4126 O me! O me! My child, my only life,
4127 Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.
4128 Help, help! Call help.
4129 
4130 [Enter Capulet.]
4131 
4132 
4133 CAPULET
4134 For shame, bring Juliet forth. Her lord is come.
4135 
4136 NURSE
4137 She's dead, deceased. She's dead, alack the day!
4138 
4139 LADY CAPULET
4140 Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead.
4141 
4142 CAPULET
4143 Ha, let me see her! Out, alas, she's cold.
4144 Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.
4145 Life and these lips have long been separated.
4146 Death lies on her like an untimely frost
4147 Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
4148 
4149 NURSE
4150 O lamentable day!
4151 
4152 LADY CAPULET  O woeful time!
4153 
4154 CAPULET
4155 Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
4156 Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
4157 
4158 [Enter Friar Lawrence and the County Paris, with
4159 Musicians.]
4160 
4161 
4162 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4163 Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
4164 
4165 CAPULET
4166 Ready to go, but never to return.--
4167 O son, the night before thy wedding day
4168 Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
4169 Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
4170 Death is my son-in-law; Death is my heir.
4171 My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
4172 And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
4173 
4174 PARIS
4175 Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
4176 And doth it give me such a sight as this?
4177 
4178 LADY CAPULET
4179 Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
4180 Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
4181 In lasting labor of his pilgrimage!
4182 But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
4183 But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
4184 And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!
4185 
4186 NURSE
4187 O woe, O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
4188 Most lamentable day, most woeful day
4189 That ever, ever I did yet behold!
4190 O day, O day, O day, O hateful day!
4191 Never was seen so black a day as this!
4192 O woeful day, O woeful day!
4193 
4194 PARIS
4195 Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
4196 Most detestable death, by thee beguiled,
4197 By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!
4198 O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!
4199 
4200 CAPULET
4201 Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
4202 Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
4203 To murder, murder our solemnity?
4204 O child! O child! My soul and not my child!
4205 Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,
4206 And with my child my joys are buried.
4207 
4208 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4209 Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
4210 In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
4211 Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all,
4212 And all the better is it for the maid.
4213 Your part in her you could not keep from death,
4214 But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
4215 The most you sought was her promotion,
4216 For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced;
4217 And weep you now, seeing she is advanced
4218 Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
4219 O, in this love you love your child so ill
4220 That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
4221 She's not well married that lives married long,
4222 But she's best married that dies married young.
4223 Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
4224 On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
4225 And in her best array, bear her to church,
4226 For though fond nature bids us all lament,
4227 Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
4228 
4229 CAPULET
4230 All things that we ordained festival
4231 Turn from their office to black funeral:
4232 Our instruments to melancholy bells,
4233 Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
4234 Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
4235 Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
4236 And all things change them to the contrary.
4237 
4238 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4239 Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
4240 And go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare
4241 To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
4242 The heavens do lour upon you for some ill.
4243 Move them no more by crossing their high will.
4244 [All but the Nurse and the Musicians exit.]
4245 
4246 FIRST MUSICIAN
4247 Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
4248 
4249 NURSE
4250 Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
4251 For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
4252 
4253 FIRST MUSICIAN
4254 Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
4255 [Nurse exits.]
4256 
4257 [Enter Peter.]
4258 
4259 
4260 PETER  Musicians, O musicians, "Heart's ease,"
4261 "Heart's ease." O, an you will have me live, play
4262 "Heart's ease."
4263 
4264 FIRST MUSICIAN  Why "Heart's ease?"
4265 
4266 PETER  O musicians, because my heart itself plays "My
4267 heart is full." O, play me some merry dump to
4268 comfort me.
4269 
4270 FIRST MUSICIAN  Not a dump, we. 'Tis no time to play
4271 now.
4272 
4273 PETER  You will not then?
4274 
4275 FIRST MUSICIAN  No.
4276 
4277 PETER  I will then give it you soundly.
4278 
4279 FIRST MUSICIAN  What will you give us?
4280 
4281 PETER  No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give
4282 you the minstrel.
4283 
4284 FIRST MUSICIAN  Then will I give you the
4285 serving-creature.
4286 
4287 PETER  Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
4288 your pate. I will carry no crochets. I'll re you, I'll fa
4289 you. Do you note me?
4290 
4291 FIRST MUSICIAN  An you re us and fa us, you note us.
4292 
4293 SECOND MUSICIAN  Pray you, put up your dagger and
4294 put out your wit.
4295 
4296 PETER  Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat
4297 you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.
4298 Answer me like men.
4299 [Sings.]	When griping griefs the heart doth wound
4300 	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
4301 	Then music with her silver sound--
4302 Why "silver sound"? Why "music with her silver
4303 sound"? What say you, Simon Catling?
4304 
4305 FIRST MUSICIAN  Marry, sir, because silver hath a
4306 sweet sound.
4307 
4308 PETER  Prates.--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
4309 
4310 SECOND MUSICIAN  I say "silver sound" because musicians
4311 sound for silver.
4312 
4313 PETER  Prates too.--What say you, James Soundpost?
4314 
4315 THIRD MUSICIAN  Faith, I know not what to say.
4316 
4317 PETER  O, I cry you mercy. You are the singer. I will say
4318 for you. It is "music with her silver sound" because
4319 musicians have no gold for sounding:
4320 [Sings.]	Then music with her silver sound
4321 	With speedy help doth lend redress.
4322 [He exits.]
4323 
4324 FIRST MUSICIAN  What a pestilent knave is this same!
4325 
4326 SECOND MUSICIAN  Hang him, Jack. Come, we'll in
4327 here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.

4334 Scene 1
4335 =======
4336 [Enter Romeo.]
4337 
4338 
4339 ROMEO
4340 If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
4341 My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
4342 My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
4343 And all this day an unaccustomed spirit
4344 Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
4345 I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
4346 (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to
4347 think!)
4348 And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
4349 That I revived and was an emperor.
4350 Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed
4351 When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
4352 
4353 [Enter Romeo's man Balthasar, in riding boots.]
4354 
4355 News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar?
4356 Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
4357 How doth my lady? Is my father well?
4358 How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,
4359 For nothing can be ill if she be well.
4360 
4361 BALTHASAR
4362 Then she is well and nothing can be ill.
4363 Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,
4364 And her immortal part with angels lives.
4365 I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
4366 And presently took post to tell it you.
4367 O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
4368 Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
4369 
4370 ROMEO
4371 Is it e'en so?--Then I deny you, stars!--
4372 Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
4373 And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
4374 
4375 BALTHASAR
4376 I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
4377 Your looks are pale and wild and do import
4378 Some misadventure.
4379 
4380 ROMEO  Tush, thou art deceived.
4381 Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
4382 Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
4383 
4384 BALTHASAR
4385 No, my good lord.
4386 
4387 ROMEO  No matter. Get thee gone,
4388 And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
4389 [Balthasar exits.]
4390 Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
4391 Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
4392 To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
4393 I do remember an apothecary
4394 (And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted
4395 In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,
4396 Culling of simples. Meager were his looks.
4397 Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.
4398 And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
4399 An alligator stuffed, and other skins
4400 Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,
4401 A beggarly account of empty boxes,
4402 Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
4403 Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
4404 Were thinly scattered to make up a show.
4405 Noting this penury, to myself I said
4406 "An if a man did need a poison now,
4407 Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
4408 Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him."
4409 O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
4410 And this same needy man must sell it me.
4411 As I remember, this should be the house.
4412 Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--
4413 What ho, Apothecary!
4414 
4415 [Enter Apothecary.]
4416 
4417 
4418 APOTHECARY  Who calls so loud?
4419 
4420 ROMEO
4421 Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
4422 [He offers money.]
4423 Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
4424 A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
4425 As will disperse itself through all the veins,
4426 That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
4427 And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
4428 As violently as hasty powder fired
4429 Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
4430 
4431 APOTHECARY
4432 Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law
4433 Is death to any he that utters them.
4434 
4435 ROMEO
4436 Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
4437 And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
4438 Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,
4439 Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
4440 The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law.
4441 The world affords no law to make thee rich.
4442 Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
4443 
4444 APOTHECARY
4445 My poverty, but not my will, consents.
4446 
4447 ROMEO
4448 I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
4449 
4450 APOTHECARY, [giving him the poison]
4451 Put this in any liquid thing you will
4452 And drink it off, and if you had the strength
4453 Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
4454 
4455 ROMEO, [handing him the money]
4456 There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
4457 Doing more murder in this loathsome world
4458 Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not
4459 sell.
4460 I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
4461 Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
4462 [Apothecary exits.]
4463 Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
4464 To Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.
4465 [He exits.]

4472 FRIAR JOHN
4473 Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
4474 
4475 [Enter Friar Lawrence.]
4476 
4477 
4478 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4479 This same should be the voice of Friar John.--
4480 Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
4481 Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
4482 
4483 FRIAR JOHN
4484 Going to find a barefoot brother out,
4485 One of our order, to associate me,
4486 Here in this city visiting the sick,
4487 And finding him, the searchers of the town,
4488 Suspecting that we both were in a house
4489 Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
4490 Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth,
4491 So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.
4492 
4493 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4494 Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
4495 
4496 FRIAR JOHN
4497 I could not send it--here it is again--
4498 [Returning the letter.]
4499 Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
4500 So fearful were they of infection.
4501 
4502 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4503 Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
4504 The letter was not nice but full of charge,
4505 Of dear import, and the neglecting it
4506 May do much danger. Friar John, go hence.
4507 Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
4508 Unto my cell.
4509 
4510 FRIAR JOHN
4511 Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.	[He exits.]
4512 
4513 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4514 Now must I to the monument alone.
4515 Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
4516 She will beshrew me much that Romeo
4517 Hath had no notice of these accidents.
4518 But I will write again to Mantua,
4519 And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
4520 Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
4521 [He exits.]

4523 Scene 3
4524 =======
4525 [Enter Paris and his Page.]
4526 
4527 
4528 PARIS
4529 Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
4530 Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
4531 Under yond yew trees lay thee all along,
4532 Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground.
4533 So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
4534 (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
4535 But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me
4536 As signal that thou hearest something approach.
4537 Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.
4538 
4539 PAGE, [aside]
4540 I am almost afraid to stand alone
4541 Here in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.
4542 [He moves away from Paris.]
4543 
4544 PARIS, [scattering flowers]
4545 Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
4546 (O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)
4547 Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
4548 Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.
4549 The obsequies that I for thee will keep
4550 Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
4551 [Page whistles.]
4552 The boy gives warning something doth approach.
4553 What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
4554 To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
4555 What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.
4556 [He steps aside.]
4557 
4558 [Enter Romeo and Balthasar.]
4559 
4560 
4561 ROMEO
4562 Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
4563 Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
4564 See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
4565 Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
4566 Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
4567 And do not interrupt me in my course.
4568 Why I descend into this bed of death
4569 Is partly to behold my lady's face,
4570 But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
4571 A precious ring, a ring that I must use
4572 In dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.
4573 But, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
4574 In what I farther shall intend to do,
4575 By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
4576 And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
4577 The time and my intents are savage-wild,
4578 More fierce and more inexorable far
4579 Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
4580 
4581 BALTHASAR
4582 I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
4583 
4584 ROMEO
4585 So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
4586 [Giving money.]
4587 Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.
4588 
4589 BALTHASAR, [aside]
4590 For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
4591 His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
4592 [He steps aside.]
4593 
4594 ROMEO, [beginning to force open the tomb]
4595 Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
4596 Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
4597 Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
4598 And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
4599 
4600 PARIS
4601 This is that banished haughty Montague
4602 That murdered my love's cousin, with which grief
4603 It is supposed the fair creature died,
4604 And here is come to do some villainous shame
4605 To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
4606 [Stepping forward.]
4607 Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague.
4608 Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
4609 Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
4610 Obey and go with me, for thou must die.
4611 
4612 ROMEO
4613 I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
4614 Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
4615 Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.
4616 Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
4617 Put not another sin upon my head
4618 By urging me to fury. O, begone!
4619 By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
4620 For I come hither armed against myself.
4621 Stay not, begone, live, and hereafter say
4622 A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
4623 
4624 PARIS
4625 I do defy thy commination
4626 And apprehend thee for a felon here.
4627 
4628 ROMEO
4629 Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
4630 [They draw and fight.]
4631 
4632 PAGE
4633 O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
4634 [He exits.]
4635 
4636 PARIS
4637 O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
4638 Open the tomb; lay me with Juliet.	[He dies.]
4639 
4640 ROMEO
4641 In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face.
4642 Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
4643 What said my man when my betossed soul
4644 Did not attend him as we rode? I think
4645 He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
4646 Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
4647 Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
4648 To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,
4649 One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
4650 I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.--
4651 [He opens the tomb.]
4652 A grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,
4653 For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
4654 This vault a feasting presence full of light.--
4655 Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.
4656 [Laying Paris in the tomb.]
4657 How oft when men are at the point of death
4658 Have they been merry, which their keepers call
4659 A light'ning before death! O, how may I
4660 Call this a light'ning?--O my love, my wife,
4661 Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
4662 Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
4663 Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet
4664 Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
4665 And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--
4666 Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
4667 O, what more favor can I do to thee
4668 Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
4669 To sunder his that was thine enemy?
4670 Forgive me, cousin.--Ah, dear Juliet,
4671 Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
4672 That unsubstantial death is amorous,
4673 And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4674 Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4675 For fear of that I still will stay with thee
4676 And never from this palace of dim night
4677 Depart again. Here, here will I remain
4678 With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
4679 Will I set up my everlasting rest
4680 And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4681 From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.
4682 Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you
4683 The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4684 A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
4685 [Kissing Juliet.]
4686 Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!
4687 Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4688 The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
4689 Here's to my love. [Drinking.] O true apothecary,
4690 Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
4691 [He dies.]
4692 
4693 [Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.]
4694 
4695 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4696 Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight
4697 Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?
4698 
4699 BALTHASAR
4700 Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4701 
4702 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4703 Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
4704 What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
4705 To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
4706 It burneth in the Capels' monument.
4707 
4708 BALTHASAR
4709 It doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,
4710 One that you love.
4711 
4712 FRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?
4713 
4714 BALTHASAR  Romeo.
4715 
4716 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4717 How long hath he been there?
4718 
4719 BALTHASAR  Full half an hour.
4720 
4721 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4722 Go with me to the vault.
4723 
4724 BALTHASAR  I dare not, sir.
4725 My master knows not but I am gone hence,
4726 And fearfully did menace me with death
4727 If I did stay to look on his intents.
4728 
4729 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4730 Stay, then. I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
4731 O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
4732 
4733 BALTHASAR
4734 As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
4735 I dreamt my master and another fought,
4736 And that my master slew him.
4737 
4738 FRIAR LAWRENCE, [moving toward the tomb]
4739 Romeo!--
4740 Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
4741 The stony entrance of this sepulcher?
4742 What mean these masterless and gory swords
4743 To lie discolored by this place of peace?
4744 Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
4745 And steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
4746 Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
4747 The lady stirs.
4748 
4749 JULIET
4750 O comfortable friar, where is my lord?
4751 I do remember well where I should be,
4752 And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
4753 
4754 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4755 I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest
4756 Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
4757 A greater power than we can contradict
4758 Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
4759 Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,
4760 And Paris, too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
4761 Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
4762 Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
4763 Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
4764 
4765 JULIET
4766 Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
4767 [He exits.]
4768 What's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?
4769 Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.--
4770 O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop
4771 To help me after! I will kiss thy lips.
4772 Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
4773 To make me die with a restorative.	[She kisses him.]
4774 Thy lips are warm!
4775 
4776 [Enter Paris's Page and Watch.]
4777 
4778 
4779 FIRST WATCH  Lead, boy. Which way?
4780 
4781 JULIET
4782 Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O, happy dagger,
4783 This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.
4784 [She takes Romeo's dagger, stabs herself, and dies.]
4785 
4786 PAGE
4787 This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.
4788 
4789 FIRST WATCH
4790 The ground is bloody.--Search about the
4791 churchyard.
4792 Go, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach.
4793 [Some watchmen exit.]
4794 Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
4795 And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
4796 Who here hath lain this two days buried.--
4797 Go, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets.
4798 Raise up the Montagues. Some others search.
4799 [Others exit.]
4800 We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
4801 But the true ground of all these piteous woes
4802 We cannot without circumstance descry.
4803 
4804 [Enter Watchmen with Romeo's man Balthasar.]
4805 
4806 
4807 SECOND WATCH
4808 Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the
4809 churchyard.
4810 
4811 FIRST WATCH
4812 Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
4813 
4814 [Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.]
4815 
4816 
4817 THIRD WATCH
4818 Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
4819 We took this mattock and this spade from him
4820 As he was coming from this churchyard's side.
4821 
4822 FIRST WATCH
4823 A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.
4824 
4825 [Enter the Prince with Attendants.]
4826 
4827 
4828 PRINCE
4829 What misadventure is so early up
4830 That calls our person from our morning rest?
4831 
4832 [Enter Capulet and Lady Capulet.]
4833 
4834 
4835 CAPULET
4836 What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?
4837 
4838 LADY CAPULET
4839 O, the people in the street cry "Romeo,"
4840 Some "Juliet," and some "Paris," and all run
4841 With open outcry toward our monument.
4842 
4843 PRINCE
4844 What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4845 
4846 FIRST WATCH
4847 Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
4848 And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
4849 Warm and new killed.
4850 
4851 PRINCE
4852 Search, seek, and know how this foul murder
4853 comes.
4854 
4855 FIRST WATCH
4856 Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man,
4857 With instruments upon them fit to open
4858 These dead men's tombs.
4859 
4860 CAPULET
4861 O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4862 This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
4863 Is empty on the back of Montague,
4864 And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.
4865 
4866 LADY CAPULET
4867 O me, this sight of death is as a bell
4868 That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
4869 
4870 [Enter Montague.]
4871 
4872 
4873 PRINCE
4874 Come, Montague, for thou art early up
4875 To see thy son and heir now early down.
4876 
4877 MONTAGUE
4878 Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
4879 Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.
4880 What further woe conspires against mine age?
4881 
4882 PRINCE  Look, and thou shalt see.
4883 
4884 MONTAGUE, [seeing Romeo dead]
4885 O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
4886 To press before thy father to a grave?
4887 
4888 PRINCE
4889 Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,
4890 Till we can clear these ambiguities
4891 And know their spring, their head, their true
4892 descent,
4893 And then will I be general of your woes
4894 And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
4895 And let mischance be slave to patience.--
4896 Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4897 
4898 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4899 I am the greatest, able to do least,
4900 Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4901 Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
4902 And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4903 Myself condemned and myself excused.
4904 
4905 PRINCE
4906 Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4907 
4908 FRIAR LAWRENCE
4909 I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4910 Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4911 Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
4912 And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
4913 I married them, and their stol'n marriage day
4914 Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
4915 Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,
4916 For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4917 You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4918 Betrothed and would have married her perforce
4919 To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
4920 And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
4921 To rid her from this second marriage,
4922 Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4923 Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
4924 A sleeping potion, which so took effect
4925 As I intended, for it wrought on her
4926 The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
4927 That he should hither come as this dire night
4928 To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
4929 Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4930 But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4931 Was stayed by accident, and yesternight
4932 Returned my letter back. Then all alone
4933 At the prefixed hour of her waking
4934 Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
4935 Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
4936 Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
4937 But when I came, some minute ere the time
4938 Of her awakening, here untimely lay
4939 The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4940 She wakes, and I entreated her come forth
4941 And bear this work of heaven with patience.
4942 But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
4943 And she, too desperate, would not go with me
4944 But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4945 All this I know, and to the marriage
4946 Her nurse is privy. And if aught in this
4947 Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4948 Be sacrificed some hour before his time
4949 Unto the rigor of severest law.
4950 
4951 PRINCE
4952 We still have known thee for a holy man.--
4953 Where's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?
4954 
4955 BALTHASAR
4956 I brought my master news of Juliet's death,
4957 And then in post he came from Mantua
4958 To this same place, to this same monument.
4959 This letter he early bid me give his father
4960 And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4961 If I departed not and left him there.
4962 
4963 PRINCE
4964 Give me the letter. I will look on it.--
4965 [He takes Romeo's letter.]
4966 Where is the County's page, that raised the
4967 watch?--
4968 Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4969 
4970 PAGE
4971 He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave
4972 And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
4973 Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
4974 And by and by my master drew on him,
4975 And then I ran away to call the watch.
4976 
4977 PRINCE
4978 This letter doth make good the Friar's words,
4979 Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
4980 And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4981 Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4982 Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.
4983 Where be these enemies?--Capulet, Montague,
4984 See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4985 That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,
4986 And I, for winking at your discords too,
4987 Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.
4988 
4989 CAPULET
4990 O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
4991 This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4992 Can I demand.
4993 
4994 MONTAGUE  But I can give thee more,
4995 For I will ray her statue in pure gold,
4996 That whiles Verona by that name is known,
4997 There shall no figure at such rate be set
4998 As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4999 
5000 CAPULET
5001 As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,
5002 Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
5003 
5004 PRINCE
5005 A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
5006 The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
5007 Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.
5008 Some shall be pardoned, and some punished.
5009 For never was a story of more woe
5010 Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
5011 [All exit.]
