use mBot intermediate map
A3: start from H, cover the blacks line at the upper T junctions
A4: start from C, cover the blacks line at the upper T junctions


use mBot basic map if the above is not working
A3 & A4: the robot won't stop at the ending as desired because this map's ending is not a T shape
