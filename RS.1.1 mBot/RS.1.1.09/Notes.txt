A1 Dance Dance Dance

When green flag clicked
forever
	if distance < 10
		call dance function
		wait 10 sec
		call stop function


The codes above will make the dancing cat dance for 10 sec and stop then dance for 10 sec and stop forever if the obstacle remains nearby.

That's why we need to create a variable to set dance to 1 for 10 sec then reset dance to 0, making the dancing cat stop after 10 sec even if the obstacle remains nearby.
